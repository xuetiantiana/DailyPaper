      "abstract": "Smart homes that integrate Internet of Things (IoT) devices face increasing cybersecurity risks, posing significant challenges to these environments. The study explores security threats in smart homes ecosystems, categorizing them into vulnerabilities at the network layer, device level, and those from cloud-based and AI-driven systems. Research findings indicate that post-quantum encryption, coupled with AI-driven anomaly detection, is highly effective in enhancing security; however, computational resource demands present significant challenges. Blockchain authentication together with zero-trust structures builds security resilience, although they need changes to existing infrastructure. The specific security strategies show their effectiveness through ANOVA, Chi-square tests, and Monte Carlo simulations yet lack sufficient scalability according to the results. The research demonstrates the requirement for improvement in cryptographic techniques, alongside AI-enhanced threat detection and adaptive security models which must achieve a balance between performance and efficiency and real-time applicability within smart home ecosystems.",

      "abstract": "Multi-agent systems, which consist of multiple AI models interacting within a shared environment, are increasingly used for persona-based interactions. However, if not carefully designed, these systems can reinforce implicit biases in large language models (LLMs), raising concerns about fairness and equitable representation. We present MALIBU, a novel benchmark developed to assess the degree to which LLM-based multi-agent systems implicitly reinforce social biases and stereotypes. MALIBU evaluates bias in LLM-based multi-agent systems through scenario-based assessments. AI models complete tasks within predefined contexts, and their responses undergo evaluation by an LLM-based multi-agent judging system in two phases. In the first phase, judges score responses labeled with specific demographic personas (e.g., gender, race, religion) across four metrics. In the second phase, judges compare paired responses assigned to different personas, scoring them and selecting the superior response. Our study quantifies biases in LLM-generated outputs, revealing that bias mitigation may favor marginalized personas over true neutrality, emphasizing the need for nuanced detection, balanced fairness strategies, and transparent evaluation benchmarks in multi-agent systems.",

As such, we present AutoAdv, a novel framework that automates adversarial prompt generation to systematically evaluate and expose vulnerabilities in LLM safety mechanisms. Our approach leverages a parametric attacker LLM to produce semantically disguised malicious prompts through strategic rewriting techniques, specialized system prompts, and optimized hyperparameter configurations. The primary contribution of our work is a dynamic, multi-turn attack methodology that analyzes failed jailbreak attempts and iteratively generates refined follow-up prompts, leveraging techniques such as roleplaying, misdirection, and contextual manipulation. We quantitatively evaluate attack success rate (ASR) using the StrongREJECT (arXiv:2402.10260 [cs.CL]) framework across sequential interaction turns. Through extensive empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art models--including ChatGPT, Llama, and DeepSeek--we reveal significant vulnerabilities, with our automated attacks achieving jailbreak success rates of up to 86% for harmful content generation. Our findings reveal that current safety mechanisms remain susceptible to sophisticated multi-turn attacks, emphasizing the urgent need for more robust defense strategies.",

Through case studies in materials science, we demonstrate the application and effectiveness of these patterns.

      "abstract": "Generative zero-shot learning (ZSL) methods typically synthesize visual features for unseen classes using predefined semantic attributes, followed by training a fully supervised classification model. While effective, these methods require substantial computational resources and extensive synthetic data, thereby relaxing the original ZSL assumptions. In this paper, we propose FSIGenZ, a few-shot-inspired generative ZSL framework that reduces reliance on large-scale feature synthesis. Our key insight is that class-level attributes exhibit instance-level variability, i.e., some attributes may be absent or partially visible, yet conventional ZSL methods treat them as uniformly present. To address this, we introduce Model-Specific Attribute Scoring (MSAS), which dynamically re-scores class attributes based on model-specific optimization to approximate instance-level variability without access to unseen data. We further estimate group-level prototypes as clusters of instances based on MSAS-adjusted attribute scores, which serve as representative synthetic features for each unseen class. To mitigate the resulting data imbalance, we introduce a Dual-Purpose Semantic Regularization (DPSR) strategy while training a semantic-aware contrastive classifier (SCC) using these prototypes. Experiments on SUN, AwA2, and CUB benchmarks demonstrate that FSIGenZ achieves competitive performance using far fewer synthetic features.",

Quantization has emerged as a promising solution; however, its effectiveness is often limited by quantization errors arising from weight distributions that are not quantization-friendly and the presence of activation outliers. To address these challenges, we introduce DBellQuant, an innovative post-training quantization (PTQ) framework that achieves nearly 1-bit weight compression and 6-bit activation quantization with minimal performance degradation. DBellQuant uses Learnable Transformation for Dual-Bell (LTDB) algorithm, which transforms single-bell weight distributions into dual-bell forms to reduce binarization errors and applies inverse transformations to smooth activations. DBellQuant sets a new state-of-the-art by preserving superior model performance under aggressive weight and activation quantization. For example, on the Wikitext2 dataset, DBellQuant achieves a perplexity of 14.39 on LLaMA2-13B with 6-bit activation quantization, significantly outperforming BiLLM's 21.35 without activation quantization, underscoring its potential in compressing LLMs for real-world applications.",

In this setting, the stop gradient and exponential moving average iterative procedures are commonly used to avoid representation collapse, with excellent performance in downstream supervised applications. This presentation investigates these procedures from the dual theoretical viewpoints of optimization and dynamical systems. We first show that, in general, although they do not optimize the original objective, or for that matter, any other smooth function, they do avoid collapse. Following Tian et al. [2021], but without any of the extra assumptions used in their proofs, we then show using a dynamical system perspective that, in the linear case, minimizing the original objective function without the use of a stop gradient or exponential moving average always leads to collapse. Conversely, we finally show that the limit points of the dynamical systems associated with these two procedures are, in general, asymptotically stable equilibria, with no risk of degenerating to trivial solutions.",

      "abstract": "With the development of generative artificial intelligence and instruction tuning techniques, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made impressive progress on general reasoning tasks. Benefiting from the chain-of-thought (CoT) methodology, MLLMs can solve the visual reasoning problem step-by-step. However, existing MLLMs still face significant challenges when applied to pathology visual reasoning tasks: (1) LLMs often underperforms because they lack domain-specific information, which can lead to model hallucinations. (2) The additional reasoning steps in CoT may introduce errors, leading to the divergence of answers. To address these limitations, we propose PathCoT, a novel zero-shot CoT prompting method which integrates the pathology expert-knowledge into the reasoning process of MLLMs and incorporates self-evaluation to mitigate divergence of answers. Specifically, PathCoT guides the MLLM with prior knowledge to perform as pathology experts, and provides comprehensive analysis of the image with their domain-specific knowledge. By incorporating the experts' knowledge, PathCoT can obtain the answers with CoT reasoning. Furthermore, PathCoT incorporates a self-evaluation step that assesses both the results generated directly by MLLMs and those derived through CoT, finally determining the reliable answer. The experimental results on the PathMMU dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on pathology visual understanding and reasoning.",

Seven libraries were identified as appropriate for constructing a database for training machine learning models, giving an error rate of 2.30%. The default architectures of each method were evaluated to determine the optimal approach, leading to the selection of the MLP method as the primary choice. The method was enhanced through hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy. The quantity of hidden layers and neurons significantly influences method performance.

In this work, we present our experiences porting PyTorch-based geometric learning frameworks to Gaudi-v2 HPUs. We introduce a collection of core utilities that restore essential operations (e.g., scatter, sparse indexing, k-nearest neighbors) on Gaudi-v2 HPUs, and we consolidate sixteen guided tutorials and eleven real-world examples with diagnostic analyses of encountered failures and detailed workarounds.

      "abstract": "Background and Objective: High-throughput multi-omics technologies have proven invaluable for elucidating disease mechanisms and enabling early diagnosis. However, the high cost of multi-omics profiling imposes a significant economic burden, with over reliance on full omics data potentially leading to unnecessary resource consumption. To address these issues, we propose an uncertainty-aware, multi-view dynamic decision framework for omics data classification that aims to achieve high diagnostic accuracy while minimizing testing costs. Methodology: At the single-omics level, we refine the activation functions of neural networks to generate Dirichlet distribution parameters, utilizing subjective logic to quantify both the belief masses and uncertainty mass of classification results. Belief mass reflects the support of a specific omics modality for a disease class, while the uncertainty parameter captures limitations in data quality and model discriminability, providing a more trustworthy basis for decision-making. At the multi omics level, we employ a fusion strategy based on Dempster-Shafer theory to integrate heterogeneous modalities, leveraging their complementarity to boost diagnostic accuracy and robustness. A dynamic decision mechanism is then applied that omics data are incrementally introduced for each patient until either all data sources are utilized or the model confidence exceeds a predefined threshold, potentially before all data sources are utilized. Results and Conclusion: We evaluate our approach on four benchmark multi-omics datasets, ROSMAP, LGG, BRCA, and KIPAN. In three datasets, over 50% of cases achieved accurate classification using a single omics modality, effectively reducing redundant testing. Meanwhile, our method maintains diagnostic performance comparable to full-omics models and preserves essential biological insights.",

This study proposes a data-driven approach to forecast electricity load, generation, and deficits for 2025 using historical data from 2019 (a year marked by instability) and 2023 (a more stable year). Multiple time series models were applied, including ARIMA, seasonal ARIMA, dynamic regression ARIMA, exponential smoothing, extreme gradient boosting, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The dataset was enhanced through missing value imputation, outlier smoothing, and log transformation. Performance was assessed using mean squared error, root mean squared error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error. LSTM outperformed all other models, showing strong capabilities in modeling non-stationary and seasonal patterns. A key contribution of this work is an optimized LSTM framework that integrates exogenous factors such as temperature and humidity, offering robust performance in forecasting multiple electricity indicators. These results provide practical insights for policymakers and grid operators to enable proactive load management and resource planning in data-scarce, volatile regions.",

The present study, therefore, considers computational bottlenecks involved in hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Large Language Model (LLM)-based ReS with the aim optimizing their inference latency and training efficiency. An extensive methodology was used: hybrid GNN-LLM integrated architecture-optimization strategies(quantization, LoRA, distillation)-hardware acceleration (FPGA, DeepSpeed)-all under R 4.4.2. Experimental improvements were significant, with the optimal Hybrid + FPGA + DeepSpeed configuration reaching 13.6% more accuracy (NDCG@10: 0.75) at 40-60ms of latency, while LoRA brought down training time by 66% (3.8 hours) in comparison to the non-optimized baseline. Irrespective of domain, such as accuracy or efficiency, it can be established that hardware-software co-design and parameter-efficient tuning permit hybrid models to outperform GNN or LLM approaches implemented independently. It recommends the use of FPGA as well as LoRA for real-time deployment. Future work should involve federated learning along with advanced fusion architectures for better scalability and privacy preservation. Thus, this research marks the fundamental groundwork concerning next-generation ReS balancing low-latency response with cutting-edge personalization.",

This result positions undecidability as a pervasive constraint on prediction, modeling, and epistemic access in both natural and artificial systems. Our framework disarms oracle mimicry and challenges the view that computational limits can be circumvented through architectural innovation.

      "abstract": "Iterative search heuristics are widely recognized as state-of-the-art for solving Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). In this work, we identify and exploit a critical observation: within these solvers, a large portion of the solution remains stable, i.e., unchanged across search iterations, causing redundant computations, especially for large-scale VRPs with long subtours. To address this, we pioneer the formal study of the First-Segment-Then-Aggregate (FSTA) decomposition technique to accelerate iterative solvers. Specifically, FSTA preserves stable solution segments during the search, aggregates nodes within each segment into fixed hypernodes, and focuses the search only on unstable portions. Yet, a key challenge lies in identifying which segments should be aggregated by FSTA. To this end, we then introduce Learning-to-Segment (L2Seg), a novel neural framework to intelligently differentiate potentially stable and unstable portions for FSTA decomposition. We present three L2Seg variants: non-autoregressive (globally comprehensive but locally indiscriminate), autoregressive (locally refined but globally deficient), and their synergy, with bespoke training and inference strategies. Empirical results on CVRP and VRPTW suggest that L2Seg accelerates state-of-the-art iterative solvers by up to 7x. Additionally, we provide in-depth analysis showing NAR and AR synergy achieves best performance by combining their complementary strengths. Notably, L2Seg is a flexible framework that is compatible with traditional, learning-based, and hybrid solvers, while supporting a broad class of VRPs.",

      "abstract": "Channel coding for 6G networks is expected to support a wide range of requirements arising from heterogeneous communication scenarios. These demands challenge traditional code-specific decoders, which lack the flexibility and scalability required for next-generation systems. To tackle this problem, we propose an AI-native foundation model for unified and code-agnostic decoding based on the transformer architecture. We first introduce a cross-attention message-passing transformer (CrossMPT). CrossMPT employs two masked cross-attention blocks that iteratively update two distinct input representations-magnitude and syndrome vectors-allowing the model to effectively learn the decoding problem. Notably, our CrossMPT has achieved state-of-the-art decoding performance among single neural decoders. Building on this, we develop foundation CrossMPT (FCrossMPT) by making the architecture invariant to code length, rate, and class, allowing a single trained model to decode a broad range of codes without retraining. To further enhance decoding performance, particularly for short blocklength codes, we propose CrossMPT ensemble decoder (CrossED), an ensemble decoder composed of multiple parallel CrossMPT blocks employing different parity-check matrices. This architecture can also serve as a foundation model, showing strong generalization across diverse code types. Overall, the proposed AI-native code-agnostic decoder offers flexibility, scalability, and high performance, presenting a promising direction to channel coding for 6G networks.",

However, complex AI model architectures pose high computational complexity to obtain the optimal model splitting. In this paper, we represent an arbitrary AI model as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and then reformulate the optimal model splitting problem as a minimum s-t cut search problem. To solve the problem, we propose a fast DAG-based model splitting algorithm, which restructures the DAG to enable the optimal model splitting identification via a maximum flow method. Theoretical analysis indicates that the proposed algorithm is optimal. Furthermore, considering AI models with block structures, we propose a block-wise model splitting algorithm to reduce computational complexity. The algorithm abstracts each block, i.e., a component consisting of multiple layers, into a single vertex, thereby obtaining the optimal model splitting via a simplified DAG. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can determine the optimal model splitting within milliseconds, as well as reduce training delay by 24.62%-38.95% in dynamic edge networks as compared to the state-of-the-art benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "The issue of data-driven neural network model construction is one of the core problems in the domain of Artificial Intelligence. A standard approach assumes a fixed architecture with trainable weights. A conceptually more advanced assumption is that we not only train the weights, but also find out the optimal model architecture. We present a new method that realizes just that. This article is an extended version of our conference paper titled \"Dynamic Growing and Shrinking of Neural Networks with Monte Carlo Tree Search [26]\". In the paper, we show in detail how to create a neural network with a procedure that allows dynamic shrinking and growing of the model while it is being trained. The decision-making mechanism for the architectural design is governed by a Monte Carlo tree search procedure which simulates network behavior and allows to compare several candidate architecture changes to choose the best one. The proposed method was validated using both visual and time series datasets, demonstrating its particular effectiveness in multivariate time series classification. This is attributed to the architecture's ability to adapt dynamically, allowing independent modifications for each time series. The approach is supplemented by Python source code for reproducibility. Experimental evaluations in visual pattern and multivariate time series classification tasks revealed highly promising performance, underscoring the method's robustness and adaptability.",

      "abstract": "Cardiac biosignals, such as electrocardiograms (ECG) and photoplethysmograms (PPG), are of paramount importance for the diagnosis, prevention, and management of cardiovascular diseases, and have been extensively used in a variety of clinical tasks. Conventional deep learning approaches for analyzing these signals typically rely on homogeneous datasets and static bespoke models, limiting their robustness and generalizability across diverse clinical settings and acquisition protocols. In this study, we present a cardiac sensing foundation model (CSFM) that leverages advanced transformer architectures and a generative, masked pretraining strategy to learn unified representations from vast, heterogeneous health records. Our model is pretrained on an innovative multi-modal integration of data from multiple large-scale datasets (including MIMIC-III-WDB, MIMIC-IV-ECG, and CODE), comprising cardiac signals and the corresponding clinical or machine-generated text reports from approximately 1.7 million individuals. We demonstrate that the embeddings derived from our CSFM not only serve as effective feature extractors across diverse cardiac sensing scenarios, but also enable seamless transfer learning across varying input configurations and sensor modalities. Extensive evaluations across diagnostic tasks, demographic information recognition, vital sign measurement, clinical outcome prediction, and ECG question answering reveal that CSFM consistently outperforms traditional one-modal-one-task approaches. Notably, CSFM exhibits robust performance across multiple ECG lead configurations from standard 12-lead systems to single-lead setups, and in scenarios where only ECG, only PPG, or a combination thereof is available. These findings highlight the potential of CSFM as a versatile and scalable solution, for comprehensive cardiac monitoring.",

Here, we aim to solve these gaps by proposing a variational digital twin (VDT) framework that augments standard neural architectures with a single Bayesian output layer. This lightweight addition, along with a novel VDT updating algorithm, lets a twin update in seconds on commodity GPUs while producing calibrated uncertainty bounds that can inform experiment design, control algorithms, and model reliability. The VDT is evaluated on four energy-sector problems. For critical-heat-flux prediction, uncertainty-driven active learning reaches R2 = 0.98 using 47 % fewer experiments and one-third the training time of random sampling. A three-year renewable-generation twin maintains R2 > 0.95 for solar output and curbs error growth for volatile wind forecasts via monthly updates that process only one month of data at a time. A nuclear reactor transient cooldown twin reconstructs thermocouple signals with R2 > 0.99 and preserves accuracy after 50 % sensor loss, demonstrating robustness to degraded instrumentation. Finally, a physics-informed Li-ion battery twin, retrained after every ten discharges, lowers voltage mean-squared error by an order of magnitude relative to the best static model while adapting its credible intervals as the cell approaches end-of-life. These results demonstrate that combining modest Bayesian augmentation with efficient update schemes turns conventional surrogates into uncertainty-aware, data-efficient, and computationally tractable DTs, paving the way for dependable models across industrial and scientific energy systems.",

Since then, the 3W Dataset has been developed collaboratively and has become a foundational reference for numerous works in the field. This data article describes the current publicly available version of the 3W Dataset, which contains structural modifications and additional labeled data.

We propose a systematic approach to transform an echocardiographic EHR dataset of unstructured nature into a Query-Passage dataset, framing the problem as a Cohort Retrieval task. Additionally, we design and implement evaluation metrics inspired by real-world clinical scenarios to rigorously test the models across diverse retrieval tasks.

      "abstract": "The widespread dissemination of toxic content on social media poses a serious threat to both online environments and public discourse, highlighting the urgent need for detoxification methods that effectively remove toxicity while preserving the original semantics. However, existing approaches often struggle to simultaneously achieve strong detoxification performance, semantic preservation, and robustness to out-of-distribution data. Moreover, they typically rely on costly, manually annotated parallel corpora while showing poor data efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage training framework that jointly optimizes for data efficiency, semantic preservation, and model generalization. We first perform supervised fine-tuning on a small set of high-quality, filtered parallel data to establish a strong initialization. Then, we leverage unlabeled toxic inputs and a custom-designed reward model to train the LLM using Group Relative Policy Optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates the trade-offs faced by previous work, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved generalization and significantly reduced dependence on annotated data.

This chapter examines how the conventional notion of consent, while fundamental to data protection and privacy rights, proves insufficient in addressing the implications of AI-generated content derived from personal data. Through legal and ethical analysis, we show that while individuals can consent to the initial use of their data for AI training, they cannot meaningfully consent to the numerous potential outputs their data might enable or the extent to which the output is used or distributed. We identify three fundamental challenges: the scope problem, the temporality problem, and the autonomy trap, which collectively create what we term a ''consent gap'' in AI systems and their surrounding ecosystem. We argue that current legal frameworks inadequately address these emerging challenges, particularly regarding individual autonomy, identity rights, and social responsibility, especially in cases where AI-generated content creates new forms of personal representation beyond the scope of the original consent. By examining how these consent limitations intersect with broader principles of responsible AI (including fairness, transparency, accountability, and autonomy) we demonstrate the need to evolve ethical and legal approaches to consent.",

Building upon earlier work on long-sequence Hopfield memory models, we propose a temporal kernal $K(m, k)$ to incorporate temporal dependencies, enabling efficient sequential retrieval of patterns over extended sequences. We demonstrate the successful application of this technique for the storage and sequential retrieval of movies frames which are well suited for this because of the high dimensional vectors that make up each frame creating enough variation between even sequential frames in the high dimensional space. The technique has applications in modern transformer architectures, including efficient long-sequence modeling, memory augmentation, improved attention with temporal bias, and enhanced handling of long-term dependencies in time-series data. Our model offers a promising approach to address the limitations of transformers in long-context tasks, with potential implications for natural language processing, forecasting, and beyond.",

Foremost among them is Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV), the world's largest open-source EHR database. However, the inherent complexity of these datasets, particularly the need for sophisticated querying skills and the need to understand the underlying clinical settings, often presents a significant barrier to their effective use. M3 lowers the technical barrier to understanding and querying MIMIC-IV data. With a single command it retrieves MIMIC-IV from PhysioNet, launches a local SQLite instance (or hooks into the hosted BigQuery), and-via the Model Context Protocol (MCP)-lets researchers converse with the database in plain English. Ask a clinical question in natural language; M3 uses a language model to translate it into SQL, executes the query against the MIMIC-IV dataset, and returns structured results alongside the underlying query for verifiability and reproducibility. Demonstrations show that minutes of dialogue with M3 yield the kind of nuanced cohort analyses that once demanded hours of handcrafted SQL and relied on understanding the complexities of clinical workflows. By simplifying access, M3 invites the broader research community to mine clinical critical-care data and accelerates the translation of raw records into actionable insight.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in materials discovery have been driven by structure-based models, particularly those using crystal graphs. While effective for computational datasets, these models are impractical for real-world applications where atomic structures are often unknown or difficult to obtain. We propose a scalable multimodal framework that learns directly from elemental composition and X-ray diffraction (XRD) -- two of the more available modalities in experimental workflows without requiring crystal structure input. Our architecture integrates modality-specific encoders with a cross-attention fusion module and is trained on the 5-million-sample Alexandria dataset. We present masked XRD modeling (MXM), and apply MXM and contrastive alignment as self-supervised pretraining strategies. Pretraining yields faster convergence (up to 4.2x speedup) and improves both accuracy and representation quality. We further demonstrate that multimodal performance scales more favorably with dataset size than unimodal baselines, with gains compounding at larger data regimes. Our results establish a path toward structure-free, experimentally grounded foundation models for materials science.",

      "abstract": "Flooding can damage pavement infrastructure significantly, causing both immediate and long-term structural and functional issues. This research investigates how flooding events affect pavement deterioration, specifically focusing on measuring pavement roughness by the International Roughness Index (IRI). To quantify these effects, we utilized 20 years of pavement condition data from TxDOT's PMIS database, which is integrated with flood event data, including duration and spatial extent. Statistical analyses were performed to compare IRI values before and after flooding and to calculate the deterioration rates influenced by flood exposure. Moreover, we applied Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), to assess the impact of flooding on pavement performance. The results demonstrate that flood-affected pavements experience a more rapid increase in roughness compared to non-flooded sections. These findings emphasize the need for proactive flood mitigation strategies, including improved drainage systems, flood-resistant materials, and preventative maintenance, to enhance pavement resilience in vulnerable regions.",

This research presents a complex framework that leverages Data Science methodologies, notably Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, to improve the efficiency of analyzing Calcutta High Court verdicts. Our framework focuses on two key aspects: first, the creation of a robust summarization mechanism that distills complex legal texts into concise and coherent summaries; and second, the development of an intelligent system for retrieving similar cases, which will assist legal professionals in research and decision making. By fine-tuning the Pegasus model using case head note summaries, we achieve significant improvements in the summarization of legal cases. Our two-step summarizing technique preserves crucial legal contexts, allowing for the production of a comprehensive vector database for RAG. The RAG-powered framework efficiently retrieves similar cases in response to user queries, offering thorough overviews and summaries. This technique not only improves legal research efficiency, but it also helps legal professionals and students easily acquire and grasp key legal information, benefiting the overall legal scenario.",

However, existing communication media -- including raw sensor data, neural network features, and perception results -- suffer limitations in bandwidth efficiency, information completeness, and agent interoperability. Moreover, traditional approaches have largely ignored decision-level fusion, neglecting critical dimensions of collaborative driving. In this paper we argue that addressing these challenges requires a transition from purely perception-oriented data exchanges to explicit intent and reasoning communication using natural language. Natural language balances semantic density and communication bandwidth, adapts flexibly to real-time conditions, and bridges heterogeneous agent platforms. By enabling the direct communication of intentions, rationales, and decisions, it transforms collaborative driving from reactive perception-data sharing into proactive coordination, advancing safety, efficiency, and transparency in intelligent transportation systems.",

      "abstract": "The exponential development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies like ChatGPT has raised increasing curiosity about their use in higher education, specifically with respect to how students view them, make use of them, and the implications for learning outcomes. This paper employs a hybrid methodological approach involving a systematic literature review and simulation-based modeling to explore student perceptions of GenAI use in the context of higher education. A total of nineteen empirical articles from 2023 through 2025 were selected from the PRISMA-based search targeting the Scopus database. Synthesis of emerging patterns from the literature was achieved by thematic categorization. Six of these had enough quantitative information, i.e., item-level means and standard deviations, to permit probabilistic modeling. One dataset, from the resulting subset, was itself selected as a representative case with which to illustrate inverse-variance weighting by Monte Carlo simulation, by virtue of its well-designed Likert scale format and thematic alignment with the use of computing systems by the researcher.\n  The simulation provided a composite \"Success Score\" forecasting the strength of the relationship between student perceptions and learning achievements. Findings reveal that attitude factors concerned with usability and real-world usefulness are significantly better predictors of positive learning achievement than affective or trust-based factors. Such an interdisciplinary perspective provides a unique means of linking thematic results with predictive modelling, resonating with longstanding controversies about the proper use of GenAI tools within the university.",

This research integrates foundational work with recent empirical findings to deliver a detailed analysis of dating app recommendation systems, highlighting key issues and suggesting research-backed solutions. Through analysis of reciprocal recommendation frameworks, fairness evaluation metrics, and industry implementations, we demonstrate that current systems achieve modest performance with collaborative filtering reaching 25.1\\% while reciprocal methods achieve 28.7\\%.

      "abstract": "As hybrid, distributed, and asynchronous work models become more prevalent, continuous learning in Agile Software Development (ASD) gains renewed importance. Communities of Practice (CoPs) are increasingly adopted to support social learning beyond formal education, often relying on virtual communication. Psychological safety, a prerequisite for effective learning, remains insufficiently understood in these settings. This mixed-methods study investigates psychological safety within Agile CoPs through survey data from 143 participants. Results indicate that psychological safety is significantly lower in online interactions compared to face-to-face settings. Moreover, low psychological safety reduces participants' intent to continue contributing and avoidance of interpersonal risk. No significant differences emerged based on gender, community seniority, or content creation activity. However, differences by role and age group suggest potential generational or role-related effects. Thematic analysis revealed exclusionary behavior, negative interaction patterns, and hostility as primary threats to psychological safety, often reinforced by tribalism and specific community dynamics. Suggested interventions include establishing explicit norms, structured facilitation, and active moderation. The findings were validated through member checking with 30 participants. This study provides a comparative perspective on interaction modalities and offers practical guidance for organizers seeking to cultivate inclusive, high-impact CoPs and similarly structured virtual or hybrid work environments.",

      "abstract": "Video understanding plays a fundamental role for content moderation on short video platforms, enabling the detection of inappropriate content. While classification remains the dominant approach for content moderation, it often struggles in scenarios requiring rapid and cost-efficient responses, such as trend adaptation and urgent escalations. To address this issue, we introduce an Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) method designed to complement traditional classification approaches. We first leverage a Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL) framework to train a suite of foundation embedding models, including both single-modal and multi-modal architectures. Our models demonstrate superior performance over established contrastive learning methods such as CLIP and MoCo. Building on these embedding models, we design and implement the embedding-based retrieval system that integrates embedding generation and video retrieval to enable efficient and effective trend handling. Comprehensive offline experiments on 25 diverse emerging trends show that EBR improves ROC-AUC from 0.85 to 0.99 and PR-AUC from 0.35 to 0.95. Further online experiments reveal that EBR increases action rates by 10.32% and reduces operational costs by over 80%, while also enhancing interpretability and flexibility compared to classification-based solutions.",

Latest foundational models trained for time series forecasting show strengths (e.g., for long sequences and in zero-shot settings). However, foundational model was not yet used for forecasting rare, spiky events, i.e., a challenging target because those are a corner case of extreme events. In this paper, we optimize a state-of-the-art foundational model to forecast sporadic or spiky production outages of high-performance machine learning services powering billions of client devices. We evaluate the forecasting errors of the foundational model compared with classical stochastic forecasting models (e.g., moving average and autoregressive). The analysis helps us understand how each of the evaluated models performs for the sporadic or spiky events. For example, it identifies the key patterns in the target data that are well tracked by the foundational model vs. each of the stochastic models. We use the models with optimal parameters to estimate a year-long outage statistics of a particular root cause with less than 6% value errors.",

A Stacking Ensemble model achieves superior performance, surpassing a hybrid bidirectional GRU model and reaching nearly 99% classification accuracy. SHAP interpretability analysis reveals that time (seconds) is the most influential factor in distinguishing gait patterns.

Agentic AI, characterized by autonomy, goal-driven behavior, and multi-agent collaboration, redefines product managers (PMs) as orchestrators of socio-technical ecosystems. Using systems theory, co-evolutionary theory, and human-AI interaction theory, the framework maps agentic AI capabilities in discovery, scoping, business case development, development, testing, and launch. An integrative review of 70+ sources, including case studies from leading tech firms, highlights PMs' evolving roles in AI orchestration, supervision, and strategic alignment. Findings emphasize mutual adaptation between PMs and AI, requiring skills in AI literacy, governance, and systems thinking. Addressing gaps in traditional frameworks, this study provides a foundation for future research and practical implementation to ensure responsible, effective agentic AI integration in software organizations.",

      "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in molecular property prediction. However, traditional graph representations struggle to effectively encode the inherent 3D spatial structures of molecules, as molecular orientations in 3D space introduce significant variability, severely limiting model generalization and robustness. Existing approaches primarily focus on rotation-invariant and rotation-equivariant methods. Invariant methods often rely heavily on prior knowledge and lack sufficient generalizability, while equivariant methods suffer from high computational costs. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel plug-and-play 3D encoding module leveraging rotational sampling. By computing the expectation over the SO(3) rotational group, the method naturally achieves approximate rotational invariance. Furthermore, by introducing a carefully designed post-alignment strategy, strict invariance can be achieved without compromising performance. Experimental evaluations on the QM9 and C10 Datasets demonstrate superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and generalization performance compared to existing methods. Moreover, the proposed approach maintains low computational complexity and enhanced interpretability, providing a promising direction for efficient and effective handling of 3D molecular information in drug discovery and material design.",

      "abstract": "As the demand for large scale AI models continues to grow, the optimization of their training to balance computational efficiency, execution time, accuracy and energy consumption represents a critical multidimensional challenge. Achieving this balance requires not only innovative algorithmic techniques and hardware architectures but also comprehensive tools for monitoring, analyzing, and understanding the underlying processes involved in model training and deployment. Provenance data information about the origins, context, and transformations of data and processes has become a key component in this pursuit. By leveraging provenance, researchers and engineers can gain insights into resource usage patterns, identify inefficiencies, and ensure reproducibility and accountability in AI development workflows. For this reason, the question of how distributed resources can be optimally utilized to scale large AI models in an energy efficient manner is a fundamental one. To support this effort, we introduce the yProv4ML library, a tool designed to collect provenance data in JSON format, compliant with the W3C PROV and ProvML standards. yProv4ML focuses on flexibility and extensibility, and enables users to integrate additional data collection tools via plugins. The library is fully integrated with the yProv framework, allowing for higher level pairing in tasks run also through workflow management systems.",

Our results demonstrate that for smaller graphs, the algorithms consistently achieve MV set sizes aligning with theoretical bounds. However, for larger instances, achieved solution sizes notably diverge from theoretical limits; this, combined with the absence of tight bounds, complicates absolute quality assessment. Nevertheless, validation on known optimal graphs showed the Genetic Algorithm and other heuristics empirically performing best among tested methods.",

We propose a novel decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) to detect anomalies in Electronic Control Unit (ECU) communication logs. Our approach addresses two key challenges: the lack of LLMs tailored for ECU communication and the complexity of inconsistent ground truth data. By learning from UDP communication logs, we formulate anomaly detection simply as identifying deviations in time from normal behavior. We introduce an entropy regularization technique that increases model's uncertainty in known anomalies while maintaining consistency in similar scenarios. Our solution offers three novelties: a decoder-only anomaly detection architecture, a way to handle inconsistent labeling, and an adaptable LLM for different ECU communication use cases. By leveraging the generative capabilities of decoder-only models, we present a new technique that addresses the high cost and error-prone nature of manual labeling through a more scalable system that is able to learn from a minimal set of examples, while improving detection accuracy in complex communication environments.",

      "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven effective on server infrastructures, but its application on mobile devices is still underexplored due to limited memory and power resources. Existing vector search and RAG solutions largely assume abundant computation resources, making them impractical for on-device scenarios. In this paper, we propose MobileRAG, a fully on-device pipeline that overcomes these limitations by combining a mobile-friendly vector search algorithm, \\textit{EcoVector}, with a lightweight \\textit{Selective Content Reduction} (SCR) method. By partitioning and partially loading index data, EcoVector drastically reduces both memory footprint and CPU usage, while the SCR method filters out irrelevant text to diminish Language Model (LM) input size without degrading accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrated that MobileRAG significantly outperforms conventional vector search and RAG methods in terms of latency, memory usage, and power consumption, while maintaining accuracy and enabling offline operation to safeguard privacy in resource-constrained environments.",

      "abstract": "Triage errors, including undertriage and overtriage, are persistent challenges in emergency departments (EDs). With increasing patient influx and staff shortages, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into triage protocols has gained attention. This study compares the performance of three AI models [Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLM), and Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA)] in predicting triage outcomes against the FRENCH scale and clinical practice.We conducted a retrospective analysis of a prospectively recruited cohort gathering adult patient triage data over a 7-month period at the Roger Salengro Hospital ED (Lille, France). Three AI models were trained and validated : (1) TRIAGEMASTER (NLP), (2) URGENTIAPARSE (LLM), and (3) EMERGINET (JEPA). Data included demographic details, verbatim chief complaints, vital signs, and triage outcomes based on the FRENCH scale and GEMSA coding. The primary outcome was the concordance of AI-predicted triage level with the FRENCH gold-standard. It was assessed thanks to various indicators : F1-Score, Weighted Kappa, Spearman, MAE, RMSE. The LLM model (URGENTIAPARSE) showed higher accuracy (composite score: 2.514) compared to JEPA (EMERGINET, 0.438) and NLP (TRIAGEMASTER, -3.511), outperforming nurse triage (-4.343). Secondary analyses highlighted the effectiveness of URGENTIAPARSE in predicting hospitalization needs (GEMSA) and its robustness with structured data versus raw transcripts (either for GEMSA prediction or for FRENCH prediction). LLM architecture, through abstraction of patient representations, offers the most accurate triage predictions among tested models. Integrating AI into ED workflows could enhance patient safety and operational efficiency, though integration into clinical workflows requires addressing model limitations and ensuring ethical transparency.",

Human guides provide tailored instructions and responsiveness to internal cognitive states, but limit scalability. Can generative AI and neurotechnology provide a scalable alternative? Here we test ANTIDOTE, combining AI guidance and pupillometry to automatically deliver and monitor an evidence-based digital treatment, specifically the Imagery Competing Task Intervention (ICTI), to reduce intrusive memories after psychological trauma. One hundred healthy volunteers were exposed to videos of traumatic events and randomly assigned to an intervention or active control condition. As predicted, intervention participants reported significantly fewer intrusive memories over the following week. Post-hoc assessment against clinical rubrics confirmed the AI guide delivered the intervention successfully. Additionally, pupil size tracked intervention engagement and predicted symptom reduction, providing a candidate biomarker of intervention effectiveness. These findings open a path toward rigorous AI-guided digital interventions that can scale to trauma prevalence.",

      "abstract": "In this note, we elaborate on and explain in detail the proof given by Ziyin et al. (2025) of the \"perfect\" Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH) for the embedded deep linear network model (EDLN). We show that if trained with SGD, two EDLNs with different widths and depths and trained on different data will become Perfectly Platonic, meaning that every possible pair of layers will learn the same representation up to a rotation. Because most of the global minima of the loss function are not Platonic, that SGD only finds the perfectly Platonic solution is rather extraordinary. The proof also suggests at least six ways the PRH can be broken. We also show that in the EDLN model, the emergence of the Platonic representations is due to the same reason as the emergence of progressive sharpening. This implies that these two seemingly unrelated phenomena in deep learning can, surprisingly, have a common cause. Overall, the theory and proof highlight the importance of understanding emergent \"entropic forces\" due to the irreversibility of SGD training and their role in representation learning. The goal of this note is to be instructive and avoid lengthy technical details.",

While recent video generation models have shown strong potential in modeling dynamic scenes, generating videos that are both temporally coherent and geometrically consistent across camera views remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose a 4D video generation model that enforces multi-view 3D consistency of videos by supervising the model with cross-view pointmap alignment during training. This geometric supervision enables the model to learn a shared 3D representation of the scene, allowing it to predict future video sequences from novel viewpoints based solely on the given RGB-D observations, without requiring camera poses as inputs. Compared to existing baselines, our method produces more visually stable and spatially aligned predictions across multiple simulated and real-world robotic datasets. We further show that the predicted 4D videos can be used to recover robot end-effector trajectories using an off-the-shelf 6DoF pose tracker, supporting robust robot manipulation and generalization to novel camera viewpoints.",

      "abstract": "Python is a widely adopted programming language, valued for its simplicity and flexibility. However, its dynamic type system poses significant challenges for automated refactoring - an essential practice in software evolution aimed at improving internal code structure without changing external behavior. Understanding how type errors are introduced during refactoring is crucial, as such errors can compromise software reliability and reduce developer productivity. In this work, we propose a static analysis technique to detect type errors introduced by refactoring implementations for Python. We evaluated our technique on Rope refactoring implementations, applying them to open-source Python projects. Our analysis uncovered 29 bugs across four refactoring types from a total of 1,152 refactoring attempts. Several of these issues were also found in widely used IDEs such as PyCharm and PyDev. All reported bugs were submitted to the respective developers, and some of them were acknowledged and accepted. These results highlight the need to improve the robustness of current Python refactoring tools to ensure the correctness of automated code transformations and support reliable software maintenance.",

      "abstract": "Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a high-performance technique for novel view synthesis, enabling real-time rendering and high-quality reconstruction of small scenes. However, scaling to larger environments has so far relied on partitioning the scene into chunks -- a strategy that introduces artifacts at chunk boundaries, complicates training across varying scales, and is poorly suited to unstructured scenarios such as city-scale flyovers combined with street-level views. Moreover, rendering remains fundamentally limited by GPU memory, as all visible chunks must reside in VRAM simultaneously. We introduce A LoD of Gaussians, a framework for training and rendering ultra-large-scale Gaussian scenes on a single consumer-grade GPU -- without partitioning. Our method stores the full scene out-of-core (e.g., in CPU memory) and trains a Level-of-Detail (LoD) representation directly, dynamically streaming only the relevant Gaussians. A hybrid data structure combining Gaussian hierarchies with Sequential Point Trees enables efficient, view-dependent LoD selection, while a lightweight caching and view scheduling system exploits temporal coherence to support real-time streaming and rendering. Together, these innovations enable seamless multi-scale reconstruction and interactive visualization of complex scenes -- from broad aerial views to fine-grained ground-level details.",

This limitation becomes particularly apparent in complex terrains. Obstacle negotiation, a critical scenario exemplifying such challenges, requires both real-time perception of obstacle geometry and responsiveness to user intention about when and where to step over or onto, to dynamically adjust swing trajectories. We propose a novel control strategy that fuses environmental awareness and human cooperativeness: an on-board depth camera detects obstacles ahead of swing phase, prompting an elevated early-swing trajectory to ensure clearance, while late-swing control defers to natural biomechanical cues from the user. This approach enables intuitive stepping strategies without requiring unnatural movement patterns. Experiments with three non-amputee participants demonstrated 100 percent success across more than 150 step-overs and 30 step-ons with randomly placed obstacles of varying heights (4-16 cm) and distances (15-70 cm). By effectively addressing obstacle navigation -- a gateway challenge for complex terrain mobility -- our system demonstrates adaptability to both environmental constraints and user intentions, with promising applications across diverse locomotion scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Efficient workload scheduling is a critical challenge in modern heterogeneous computing environments, particularly in high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Traditional software-based schedulers struggle to efficiently balance workload distribution due to high scheduling overhead, lack of adaptability to dynamic workloads, and suboptimal resource utilization. These pitfalls are compounded in heterogeneous systems, where differing computational elements can have vastly different performance profiles. To resolve these hindrances, we present a novel FPGA-based accelerator for stochastic online scheduling (SOS). We modify a greedy cost selection assignment policy by adapting existing cost equations to engage with discretized time before implementing them into a hardware accelerator design. Our design leverages hardware parallelism, precalculation, and precision quantization to reduce job scheduling latency. By introducing a hardware-accelerated approach to real-time scheduling, this paper establishes a new paradigm for adaptive scheduling mechanisms in heterogeneous computing systems. The proposed design achieves high throughput, low latency, and energy-efficient operation, offering a scalable alternative to traditional software scheduling methods. Experimental results demonstrate consistent workload distribution, fair machine utilization, and up to 1060x speedup over single-threaded software scheduling policy implementations. This makes the SOS accelerator a strong candidate for deployment in high-performance computing system, deeplearning pipelines, and other performance-critical applications.",

Existing automatic simplification technology is quite mature, but is not sensitive to the heightened importance of distinct semantic model regions such as faces and limbs, nor to simplification constraints imposed by model usage such as animation. semisimp allows users to preserve such regions by intervening in the simplification process. Users can manipulate the order in which basic simplifications are applied to redistribute model detail, improve the simplified models themselves by repositioning vertices with propagation to neighboring levels of detail, and adjust the hierarchical partitioning of the model surface to segment simplification and improve control of reordering and position propagation.",

Finding a balance between lightweight and accurate computations is a solid foundation for this direction.

Solving PDEs for various initial and boundary conditions requires significant computational resources. The method suggested automatically extracts key modes and system dynamics using them to construct predictions, reducing computational costs compared to traditional numerical methods.

In this literature review, we synthesize findings from 147 peer-reviewed papers published between 2015 and 2025 across HCI, CSCW and social computing, ICTD, digital and public health, and AI for well-being scholarship to map the evolving reproductive well-being landscape. We identify three thematic waves that focused on early access and education, cultural sensitivity and privacy, and AI integration with policy-aware design, and highlight how technologies support or constrain diverse reproductive experiences. Our analysis reveals critical gaps in inclusivity, with persistent exclusions of men and non-binary users, migrants, and users in the Global South. Additionally, we surfaced the significant absence of literature on the role of stakeholders (e.g., husband and family members, household maids and cleaning helping hands, midwife, etc.) in the reproductive well-being space. Drawing on the findings from the literature, we propose the ReWA framework to support reproductive well-being for all agendas through six design orientations associated with: location, culture, and history; polyvocality and agency; rationality, temporality, distributive roles, and methodology.",

We leverage Sentinel-2 multispectral data and ALOS PALSAR-derived slope and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) layers to capture critical environmental features influencing landslide occurrences. Various geospatial analysis techniques are employed to assess the impact of terra in characteristics, vegetation cover, and rainfall on detection accuracy. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of multiple stateof-the-art deep learning segmentation models, including U-Net, DeepLabV3+, and Res-Net, to determine their effectiveness in landslide detection. The proposed framework contributes to the development of reliable early warning systems, improved disaster risk management, and sustainable land-use planning.

Given an open-vocabulary search instruction (e.g., \"find a person\"), VISTA enables a robot to explore its environment to search for the object of interest, while simultaneously building a real-time semantic 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of the scene. The robot navigates its environment by planning receding-horizon trajectories that prioritize semantic similarity to the query and exploration of unseen regions of the environment. To evaluate trajectories, VISTA introduces a novel, efficient viewpoint-semantic coverage metric that quantifies both the geometric view diversity and task relevance in the 3D scene. On static datasets, our coverage metric outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, FisherRF and Bayes' Rays, in computation speed and reconstruction quality. In quadrotor hardware experiments, VISTA achieves 6x higher success rates in challenging maps, compared to baseline methods, while matching baseline performance in less challenging maps. Lastly, we show that VISTA is platform-agnostic by deploying it on a quadrotor drone and a Spot quadruped robot. Open-source code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.",

However, the empirical results in these works focus on simple tasks and models and the conclusions may not generalize to model training in practice. In this paper we survey several of these variants, and develop better theoretical intuition for them as well as perform empirical studies comparing them. We find that a common intuition of aiming for unbiased estimates of second moments of gradients in adaptive optimizers is misguided, and instead that a simple technique called scale-then-privatize (which does not achieve unbiased second moments) has more desirable theoretical behaviors and outperforms all other variants we study on a small-scale language model training task. We additionally argue that scale-then-privatize causes the noise addition to better match the application of correlated noise mechanisms which are more desirable to use in practice.",

The key operation of such networks is the Clebsch-Gordan (CG) tensor product, which is computationally expensive. To accelerate the computation, we develop tensor decomposition networks (TDNs) as a class of approximately equivariant networks whose CG tensor products are replaced by low-rank tensor decompositions, such as the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition. With the CP decomposition, we prove (i) a uniform bound on the induced error of $\\rm{SO}(3)$-equivariance, and (ii) the universality of approximating any equivariant bilinear map. To further reduce the number of parameters, we propose path-weight sharing that ties all multiplicity-space weights across the $O(L^3)$ CG paths into a single path without compromising equivariance, where $L$ is the maximum angular degree. The resulting layer acts as a plug-and-play replacement for tensor products in existing networks, and the computational complexity of tensor products is reduced from $O(L^6)$ to $O(L^4)$. We evaluate TDNs on PubChemQCR, a newly curated molecular relaxation dataset containing 105 million DFT-calculated snapshots. We also use existing datasets, including OC20, and OC22. Results show that TDNs achieve competitive performance with dramatic speedup in computations.",

In this paper, we present Spectral Manifold Harmonization (SMH), a novel approach for addressing this imbalanced regression challenge on graph-structured data by generating synthetic graph samples that preserve topological properties while focusing on often underrepresented target distribution regions. Conventional methods fail in this context because they either ignore graph topology in case generation or do not target specific domain ranges, resulting in models biased toward average target values.

Visual and haptic guidance mechanisms ensure context preservation during multi-scale interaction. We demonstrate and discuss the usability of our technique for the editing of network data.",

      "abstract": "Sound source localization (SSL) adds a spatial dimension to auditory perception, allowing a system to pinpoint the origin of speech, machinery noise, warning tones, or other acoustic events, capabilities that facilitate robot navigation, human-machine dialogue, and condition monitoring. While existing surveys provide valuable historical context, they typically address general audio applications and do not fully account for robotic constraints or the latest advancements in deep learning. This review addresses these gaps by offering a robotics-focused synthesis, emphasizing recent progress in deep learning methodologies. We start by reviewing classical methods such as Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA), beamforming, Steered-Response Power (SRP), and subspace analysis. Subsequently, we delve into modern machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches, discussing traditional ML and neural networks (NNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), convolutional recurrent neural networks (CRNNs), and emerging attention-based architectures. The data and training strategy that are the two cornerstones of DL-based SSL are explored. Studies are further categorized by robot types and application domains to facilitate researchers in identifying relevant work for their specific contexts. Finally, we highlight the current challenges in SSL works in general, regarding environmental robustness, sound source multiplicity, and specific implementation constraints in robotics, as well as data and learning strategies in DL-based SSL. Also, we sketch promising directions to offer an actionable roadmap toward robust, adaptable, efficient, and explainable DL-based SSL for next-generation robots.",

      "abstract": "Embodied carbon footprint modeling has become an area of growing interest due to its significant contribution to carbon emissions in computing. However, the deterministic nature of the existing models fail to account for the spatial and temporal variability in the semiconductor supply chain. The absence of uncertainty modeling limits system designers' ability to make informed, carbon-aware decisions. We introduce CarbonClarity, a probabilistic framework designed to model embodied carbon footprints through distributions that reflect uncertainties in energy-per-area, gas-per-area, yield, and carbon intensity across different technology nodes. Our framework enables a deeper understanding of how design choices, such as chiplet architectures and new vs. old technology node selection, impact emissions and their associated uncertainties. For example, we show that the gap between the mean and 95th percentile of embodied carbon per cm$^2$ can reach up to 1.6X for the 7nm technology node. Additionally, we demonstrate through case studies that: (i) CarbonClarity is a valuable resource for device provisioning, help maintaining performance under a tight carbon budget; and (ii) chiplet technology and mature nodes not only reduce embodied carbon but also significantly lower its associated uncertainty, achieving an 18% reduction in the 95th percentile compared to monolithic designs for the mobile application.",

      "abstract": "A finite element framework is presented for analyzing crack-tip phenomena in transversely isotropic, strain-limiting elastic materials. Mechanical response is characterized by an algebraically nonlinear constitutive model, relating stress to linearized strain. Non-physical strain singularities at the crack apex are mitigated, ensuring bounded strain magnitudes. This methodology significantly advances boundary value problem (BVP) formulation, especially for first-order approximate theories. For a transversely isotropic elastic solid with a crack, the governing equilibrium equation, derived from linear momentum balance and the nonlinear constitutive model, is reduced to a second-order, vector-valued, quasilinear elliptic BVP. This BVP is solved using a robust numerical scheme combining Picard-type linearization with a continuous Galerkin finite element method for spatial discretization. Numerical results are presented for various loading conditions, including uniform tension, non-uniform slope, and parabolic loading, with two distinct material fiber orientations. It is demonstrated that crack-tip strain growth is substantially lower than stress growth. Nevertheless, strain-energy density is found to be concentrated at the crack tip, consistent with linear elastic fracture mechanics principles. The proposed framework provides a robust basis for formulating physically meaningful, rigorous BVPs, critical for investigating fundamental processes like crack propagation, damage, and nucleation in anisotropic, strain-limiting elastic solids under diverse loading conditions.",

      "abstract": "Ultrasound (US) is a widely used medical imaging modality due to its real-time capabilities, non-invasive nature, and cost-effectiveness. Robotic ultrasound can further enhance its utility by reducing operator dependence and improving access to complex anatomical regions. For this, while deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and imitation learning (IL) have shown potential for autonomous navigation, their use in complex surgical tasks such as anatomy reconstruction and surgical guidance remains limited -- largely due to the lack of realistic and efficient simulation environments tailored to these tasks. We introduce SonoGym, a scalable simulation platform for complex robotic ultrasound tasks that enables parallel simulation across tens to hundreds of environments. Our framework supports realistic and real-time simulation of US data from CT-derived 3D models of the anatomy through both a physics-based and a generative modeling approach. Sonogym enables the training of DRL and recent IL agents (vision transformers and diffusion policies) for relevant tasks in robotic orthopedic surgery by integrating common robotic platforms and orthopedic end effectors. We further incorporate submodular DRL -- a recent method that handles history-dependent rewards -- for anatomy reconstruction and safe reinforcement learning for surgery. Our results demonstrate successful policy learning across a range of scenarios, while also highlighting the limitations of current methods in clinically relevant environments. We believe our simulation can facilitate research in robot learning approaches for such challenging robotic surgery applications.

      "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) increasingly underpin technological advancements, the privacy of their training data emerges as a critical concern. Differential Privacy (DP) serves as a rigorous mechanism to protect this data, yet its integration via Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) introduces substantial challenges, primarily due to the complexities of per-sample gradient clipping. Current explicit methods, such as Opacus, necessitate extensive storage for per-sample gradients, significantly inflating memory requirements. Conversely, implicit methods like GhostClip reduce storage needs by recalculating gradients multiple times, which leads to inefficiencies due to redundant computations. This paper introduces FlashDP, an innovative cache-friendly per-layer DP-SGD that consolidates necessary operations into a single task, calculating gradients only once in a fused manner. This approach not only diminishes memory movement by up to \\textbf{50\\%} but also cuts down redundant computations by \\textbf{20\\%}, compared to previous methods. Consequently, FlashDP does not increase memory demands and achieves a \\textbf{90\\%} throughput compared to the Non-DP method on a four-A100 system during the pre-training of the Llama-13B model, while maintaining parity with standard per-layer clipped DP-SGD in terms of accuracy. These advancements establish FlashDP as a pivotal development for efficient and privacy-preserving training of LLMs. FlashDP's code has been open-sourced in https://github.com/kaustpradalab/flashdp.",

In this work, we propose to evaluate the quality of abstractive summaries by calculating overlapping events between generated summaries, reference summaries, and the original news articles.

Traditional control techniques often rely on precise system models and are sensitive to parameter uncertainties and external perturbations. To overcome these limitations, we first develop a SAC-based expert controller that demonstrates improved resilience against actuator failures, sensor noise, and attitude misalignments, outperforming our previous results in several challenging scenarios. We then use GAIL to train a learner policy that imitates the expert's trajectories, thereby reducing training costs and improving generalization through expert demonstrations. Preliminary experiments under single and combined perturbations show that the SAC expert can rotate the antenna to a specified direction and keep the antenna orientation reliably stable in most of the listed perturbations. Additionally, the GAIL learner can imitate most of the features from the trajectories generated by the SAC expert. Comparative evaluations and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the SAC algorithm and reward shaping. The integration of GAIL further reduces sample complexity and demonstrates promising imitation capabilities, paving the way for more intelligent and autonomous spacecraft control systems.",

Here we introduce cp_measure, a Python library that extracts CellProfiler's core measurement capabilities into a modular, API-first tool designed for programmatic feature extraction. We demonstrate that cp_measure features retain high fidelity with CellProfiler features while enabling seamless integration with the scientific Python ecosystem. Through applications to 3D astrocyte imaging and spatial transcriptomics, we showcase how cp_measure enables reproducible, automated image-based profiling pipelines that scale effectively for machine learning applications in computational biology.",

      "abstract": "There is growing interest in explainable recommender systems that provide recommendations along with explanations for the reasoning behind them. When evaluating recommender systems, most studies focus on overall recommendation performance. Only a few assess the quality of the explanations. Explanation quality is often evaluated through user studies that subjectively gather users' opinions on representative explanatory factors that shape end-users' perspective towards the results, not about the explanation contents itself. We aim to fill this gap by developing an objective metric to evaluate Veracity: the information quality of explanations. Specifically, we decompose Veracity into two dimensions: Fidelity and Attunement. Fidelity refers to whether the explanation includes accurate information about the recommended item. Attunement evaluates whether the explanation reflects the target user's preferences. By applying signal detection theory, we first determine decision outcomes for each dimension and then combine them to calculate a sensitivity, which serves as the final Veracity value. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed metric, we set up four cases with varying levels of information quality to validate whether our metric can accurately capture differences in quality. The results provided meaningful insights into the effectiveness of our proposed metric.",

      "abstract": "The \\textit{Nordisk familjebok} is a Swedish encyclopedia from the 19th and 20th centuries. It was written by a team of experts and aimed to be an intellectual reference, stressing precision and accuracy. This encyclopedia had four main editions remarkable by their size, ranging from 20 to 38 volumes. As a consequence, the \\textit{Nordisk familjebok} had a considerable influence in universities, schools, the media, and society overall. As new editions were released, the selection of entries and their content evolved, reflecting intellectual changes in Sweden.\n  In this paper, we used digitized versions from \\textit{Project Runeberg}. We first resegmented the raw text into entries and matched pairs of entries between the first and second editions using semantic sentence embeddings. We then extracted the geographical entries from both editions using a transformer-based classifier and linked them to Wikidata. This enabled us to identify geographic trends and possible shifts between the first and second editions, written between 1876-1899 and 1904-1926, respectively.\n  Interpreting the results, we observe a small but significant shift in geographic focus away from Europe and towards North America, Africa, Asia, Australia, and northern Scandinavia from the first to the second edition, confirming the influence of the First World War and the rise of new powers.

Comparing Reeb graphs is crucial for advancing research in this domain, yet existing metrics are often computationally prohibitive or fail to capture essential topological features effectively. In this paper, we explore the application of the Gromov-Wasserstein distance, a versatile metric for comparing metric measure spaces, to Reeb graphs. We propose a framework integrating a symmetric variant of the Reeb radius for robust geometric comparison, and a novel probabilistic weighting scheme based on Persistence Images derived from extended persistence diagrams to effectively incorporate topological significance. A key contribution of this work is the rigorous theoretical proof of the stability of our proposed Reeb Gromov-Wasserstein distance with respect to perturbations in the underlying scalar fields. This ensures that small changes in the input data lead to small changes in the computed distance between Reeb graphs, a critical property for reliable analysis. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach, including its enhanced ability to capture topological features and its proven stability, through comparisons with other alternatives on several datasets, showcasing its practical utility and theoretical soundness.",

      "abstract": "Robust and Real-time State of Charge (SOC) estimation is essential for Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries, which are widely used in electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage systems due to safety and longevity. However, the flat Open Circuit Voltage (OCV)-SOC curve makes this task particularly challenging. This challenge is complicated by hysteresis effects, and real-world conditions such as current bias, voltage quantization errors, and temperature that must be considered in the battery management system use. In this paper, we proposed an adaptive estimation approach to overcome the challenges of LFPSOC estimation. Specifically, the method uses an adaptive fisher information fusion strategy that adaptively combines the SOC estimation from two different models, which are Coulomb counting and equivalent circuit model-based parameter identification. The effectiveness of this strategy is rationalized by the information richness excited by external cycling signals. A 3D OCV-H-SOC map that captures the relationship between OCV, hysteresis, and SOC was proposed as the backbone, and can be generalizable to other widely adopted parameter-identification methods. Extensive validation under ideal and real-world use scenarios, including SOC-OCV flat zones, current bias, voltage quantization errors, low temperatures, and insufficient current excitations, have been performed using 4 driving profiles, i.e., the Orange County Transit Bus Cycle, the California Unified Cycle, the US06 Drive Cycle, and the New York City Cycle, where the results demonstrate superiority over the state-of-the-art unscented Kalman filter, long short-term memory networks and transformer in all validation cases.",

Users can train 2D diffusion models in the browser and observe the temporal dynamics of their sampling process. Diffusion Explorer leverages interactive animation, which has been shown to be a powerful tool for making engaging visualizations of dynamic systems, making it well suited to explaining diffusion models which represent stochastic processes that evolve over time.

However, since the traditional Euclidean distance is not differentiable, there is a need for alternative distance metrics that possess this property. Recently, a metric with guaranteed differentiability was proposed [1]. This approach has some important drawbacks, which we address in this paper. We provide much simpler and practical expressions for the smooth projection for general convex polytopes. Additionally, as opposed to [1], we ensure that the distance vanishes as the objects overlap.

      "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of deploying salient object detection (SOD) on resource-constrained devices with real-time performance. While recent advances in deep neural networks have improved SOD, existing top-leading models are computationally expensive. We propose an efficient network design that combines traditional wisdom on SOD and the representation power of modern CNNs. Like biologically-inspired classical SOD methods relying on computing contrast cues to determine saliency of image regions, our model leverages Pixel Difference Convolutions (PDCs) to encode the feature contrasts. Differently, PDCs are incorporated in a CNN architecture so that the valuable contrast cues are extracted from rich feature maps. For efficiency, we introduce a difference convolution reparameterization (DCR) strategy that embeds PDCs into standard convolutions, eliminating computation and parameters at inference. Additionally, we introduce SpatioTemporal Difference Convolution (STDC) for video SOD, enhancing the standard 3D convolution with spatiotemporal contrast capture. Our models, SDNet for image SOD and STDNet for video SOD, achieve significant improvements in efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. On a Jetson Orin device, our models with $<$ 1M parameters operate at 46 FPS and 150 FPS on streamed images and videos, surpassing the second-best lightweight models in our experiments by more than $2\\times$ and $3\\times$ in speed with superior accuracy.

In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate current Large Brainwave Foundation Models (LBMs) through systematic fine-tuning experiments across multiple Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) benchmark tasks, including memory tasks and sleep stage classification. Our extensive analysis shows that state-of-the-art LBMs achieve only marginal improvements (0.9%-1.2%) over traditional deep architectures while requiring significantly more parameters (millions vs thousands), raising important questions about their efficiency and applicability in BCI contexts. Moreover, through detailed ablation studies and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we significantly reduce trainable parameters without performance degradation, while demonstrating that architectural and training inefficiencies limit LBMs' current capabilities. Our experiments span both full model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient adaptation techniques, providing insights into optimal training strategies for BCI applications. We pioneer the application of LoRA to LBMs, revealing that performance benefits generally emerge when adapting multiple neural network components simultaneously. These findings highlight the critical need for domain-specific development strategies to advance LBMs, suggesting that current architectures may require redesign to fully leverage the potential of foundation models in brainwave analysis.",

The design objective is to achieve unified exponential decay for both reference tracking and disturbance rejection by minimizing the spectral abscissa of the closed-loop system. A second-order semi-discrete model accurately captures the integrator and delay dynamics while enabling efficient dominant pole extraction. These discrete-time poles are mapped to continuous time and refined using Newton-Raphson iterations on the exact transcendental characteristic equation. The method produces a unique PI gain set without requiring heuristic trade-offs or weighting parameters. Comparative simulations demonstrate that the proposed tuning achieves faster convergence and improved robustness margins compared to classical rules (Ziegler-Nichols, SIMC) and integral performance criteria (IAE, ITAE). The approach provides a transparent and computationally efficient framework for PI control in delay-dominant systems.",

      "abstract": "This work proposes a motion planning algorithm for robotic manipulators that combines sampling-based and search-based planning methods. The core contribution of the proposed approach is the usage of burs of free configuration space (C-space) as adaptive motion primitives within the graph search algorithm. Due to their feature to adaptively expand in free C-space, burs enable more efficient exploration of the configuration space compared to fixed-sized motion primitives, significantly reducing the time to find a valid path and the number of required expansions. The algorithm is implemented within the existing SMPL (Search-Based Motion Planning Library) library and evaluated through a series of different scenarios involving manipulators with varying number of degrees-of-freedom (DoF) and environment complexity. Results demonstrate that the bur-based approach outperforms fixed-primitive planning in complex scenarios, particularly for high DoF manipulators, while achieving comparable performance in simpler scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Independently trained vision and language models inhabit disjoint representational spaces, shaped by their respective modalities, objectives, and architectures. Yet an emerging hypothesis - the Platonic Representation Hypothesis - suggests that such models may nonetheless converge toward a shared statistical model of reality. This compatibility, if it exists, raises a fundamental question: can we move beyond post-hoc statistical detection of alignment and explicitly optimize for it between such disjoint representations? We cast this Platonic alignment problem as a multi-objective optimization task - preserve each modality's native structure while aligning for mutual coherence. We introduce the Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM) framework that jointly trains modality-specific autoencoders on the latent representations of pre-trained single modality models, encouraging alignment through both reconstruction and cross-modal objectives. By analogy, this framework serves as a method to escape Plato's Cave, enabling the emergence of shared structure from disjoint inputs. We evaluate this framework across three critical design axes: (i) the alignment objective - comparing contrastive loss (Con), its hard-negative variant (NegCon), and our Spread loss, (ii) the layer depth at which alignment is most effective, and (iii) the impact of foundation model scale on representational convergence. Our findings show that our lightweight Pareto-efficient framework reliably induces alignment, even across frozen, independently trained representations, offering both theoretical insight and practical pathways for transforming generalist unimodal foundations into specialist multimodal models.",

This evolution poses challenges in machine perception, especially for tasks like 3D object pose estimation in complex, dynamic environments. Our project addresses critical issues in human-robot interaction within mobile AR, focusing on non-intrusive, spatially aware interfaces. We present URSA, an LLM-driven immersive AR system developed for NASA's 2023-2024 SUITS challenge, targeting future spaceflight needs such as the Artemis missions. URSA integrates three core technologies: a head-mounted AR device (e.g., HoloLens) for intuitive visual feedback, voice control powered by large language models for hands-free interaction, and robot tracking algorithms that enable accurate 3D localization in dynamic settings. To enhance precision, we leverage digital twin localization technologies, using datasets like DTTD-Mobile and specialized hardware such as the ZED2 camera for real-world tracking under noise and occlusion. Our system enables real-time robot control and monitoring via an AR interface, even in the absence of ground-truth sensors--vital for hazardous or remote operations. Key contributions include: (1) a non-intrusive AR interface with LLM-based voice input; (2) a ZED2-based dataset tailored for non-rigid robotic bodies; (3) a Local Mission Control Console (LMCC) for mission visualization; (4) a transformer-based 6DoF pose estimator (DTTDNet) optimized for depth fusion and real-time tracking; and (5) end-to-end integration for astronaut mission support. This work advances digital twin applications in robotics, offering scalable solutions for both aerospace and industrial domains.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the intensity-based inversion method (IIM) for quantitative material parameter estimation in quasi-static elastography. In particular, we consider the problem of estimating the material parameters of a given sample from two internal measurements, one obtained before and one after applying some form of deformation. These internal measurements can be obtained via any imaging modality of choice, for example ultrasound, optical coherence or photo-acoustic tomography. Compared to two-step approaches to elastography, which first estimate internal displacement fields or strains and then reconstruct the material parameters from them, the IIM is a one-step approach which computes the material parameters directly from the internal measurements. To do so, the IIM combines image registration together with a model-based, regularized parameter reconstruction approach. This combination has the advantage of avoiding some approximations and derivative computations typically found in two-step approaches, and results in the IIM being generally more stable to measurement noise. In the paper, we provide a full convergence analysis of the IIM within the framework of inverse problems, and detail its application to linear elastography. Furthermore, we discuss the numerical implementation of the IIM and provide numerical examples simulating an optical coherence elastography (OCE) experiment.",

Studies of design practice often focus on individual designers' decisions and reflections, offering limited insight into the collaborative and systemic dimensions of professional work. In this paper, we propose a systems-level reframing of design judgment grounded in the coordination and adaptation that sustain progress amid uncertainty, constraint, and misalignment. Drawing on sustained engagement across multiple empirical studies--including ethnographic observation of design teams and qualitative studies of individual practitioners--we identify recurring episodes in which coherence was preserved not by selecting an optimal option, but by repairing alignment, adjusting plans, and reframing goals. We interpret these dynamics through the lens of Joint Cognitive Systems, which provide tools for analyzing how judgment emerges as a distributed capacity within sociotechnical activity. This perspective surfaces often-invisible work in visualization design and offers researchers a new conceptual vocabulary for studying how design activity is sustained in practice.",

Existing ABSA methods struggle to balance computational efficiency with high performance: deep learning models often lack global context, transformers demand significant computational resources, and Mamba-based approaches face CUDA dependency and diminished local correlations. Recent advancements in Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) models, particularly their efficient modeling of long-range dependencies, have significantly advanced the NLP community. However, their potential in ABSA remains untapped. To this end, we propose xLSTM with Multihead Exponential Gated Fusion (MEGA), a novel framework integrating a bi-directional mLSTM architecture with forward and partially flipped backward (PF-mLSTM) streams. The PF-mLSTM enhances localized context modeling by processing the initial sequence segment in reverse with dedicated parameters, preserving critical short-range patterns. We further introduce an mLSTM-based multihead cross exponential gated fusion mechanism (MECGAF) that dynamically combines forward mLSTM outputs as query and key with PF-mLSTM outputs as value, optimizing short-range dependency capture while maintaining global context and efficiency. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MEGA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior accuracy and efficiency in ABSA tasks.",

      "abstract": "There is a huge gap between numerous intriguing applications fostered by on-device large language model (LLM) fine-tuning (FT) from fresh mobile data and the limited resources of a mobile device. While existing server-assisted methods (e.g., split learning or side-tuning) may enable LLM FT on the local mobile device, they suffer from heavy communication burdens of activation transmissions, and may disclose data, labels or fine-tuned models to the server. To address those issues, we develop PAE MobiLLM, a privacy-aware and efficient LLM FT method which can be deployed on the mobile device via server-assisted additive side-tuning. To further accelerate FT convergence and improve computing efficiency, PAE MobiLLM integrates activation caching on the server side, which allows the server to reuse historical activations and saves the mobile device from repeatedly computing forward passes for the recurring data samples. Besides, to reduce communication cost, PAE MobiLLM develops a one-token (i.e., ``pivot'' token) activation shortcut that transmits only a single activation dimension instead of full activation matrices to guide the side network tuning. Last but not least, PAE MobiLLM introduces the additive adapter side-network design which makes the server train the adapter modules based on device-defined prediction differences rather than raw ground-truth labels. In this way, the server can only assist device-defined side-network computing, and learn nothing about data, labels or fine-tuned models.",

      "abstract": "Scientific simulation leveraging high-performance computing (HPC) systems is crucial for modeling complex systems and phenomena in fields such as astrophysics, climate science, and fluid dynamics, generating massive datasets that often reach petabyte to exabyte scales. However, managing these vast data volumes introduces significant I/O and network bottlenecks, limiting practical performance and scalability. While cutting-edge lossy compression frameworks powered by deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated superior compression ratios by capturing complex data correlations, their integration into HPC workflows poses substantial challenges due to the hybrid non-neural and neural computation patterns, causing excessive memory access overhead, large sequential stalls, and limited adaptability to varying data sizes and workloads in existing hardware platforms. To overcome these challenges and push the limit of high-performance scientific computing, we for the first time propose FLARE, a dataflow-aware and scalable hardware architecture for neural-hybrid scientific lossy compression. FLARE minimizes off-chip data access, reduces bubble overhead through efficient dataflow, and adopts a modular design that provides both scalability and flexibility, significantly enhancing throughput and energy efficiency on modern HPC systems. Particularly, the proposed FLARE achieves runtime speedups ranging from $3.50 \\times$ to $96.07 \\times$, and energy efficiency improvements ranging from $24.51 \\times$ to $520.68 \\times$, across various datasets and hardware platforms.",

With the major movement towards using a cloud computing infrastructure, our organization follows a hybrid approach with both cloud and on-prem servers. The objective of this work is to perform capacity planning, i.e., estimate resource requirements, and job scheduling for on-prem grid computing environments. A key contribution of our approach is handling uncertainty in both resource usage and duration of the jobs, a critical aspect in the finance industry where stochastic market conditions significantly influence job characteristics. For capacity planning and scheduling, we simultaneously balance two conflicting objectives: (a) minimize resource usage, and (b) provide high quality-of-service to the end users by completing jobs by their requested deadlines. We propose approximate approaches using deterministic estimators and pair sampling-based constraint programming. Our best approach (pair sampling-based) achieves much lower peak resource usage compared to manual scheduling without compromising on the quality-of-service.",

      "abstract": "The ability to find data is central to the FAIR principles underlying research data stewardship. As with the ability to reuse data, efforts to ensure and enhance findability have historically focused on discoverability of data by other researchers, but there is a growing recognition of the importance of stewarding data in a fashion that makes them FAIR for a wide range of potential reusers and stakeholders. Research institutions are one such stakeholder and have a range of motivations for discovering data, specifically those affiliated with a focal institution, from facilitating compliance with funder provisions to gathering data to inform research data services. However, many research datasets and repositories are not optimized for institutional discovery (e.g., not recording or standardizing affiliation metadata), which creates downstream obstacles to workflows designed for theoretically comprehensive discovery and to metadata-conscious data generators. Here I describe an open-source workflow for institutional tracking of research datasets at the University of Texas at Austin. This workflow comprises a multi-faceted approach that utilizes multiple open application programming interfaces (APIs) in order to address some of the common challenges to institutional discovery, such as variation in whether affiliation metadata are recorded or made public, and if so, how metadata are standardized, structured, and recorded. It is presently able to retrieve more than 4,000 affiliated datasets across nearly 70 distinct platforms, including objects without DOIs and objects without affiliation metadata. However, there remain major gaps that stem from suboptimal practices of both researchers and data repositories, many of which were identified in previous studies and which persist despite significant investment in efforts to standardize and elevate the quality of datasets and their metadata.",

Critics seized upon the findings as conclusive evidence that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) lack genuine reasoning capabilities, branding them as mere stochastic parrots. Meanwhile, defenders-spearheaded by Lawsen et al. (2025)-fired back, condemning the experimental setup as flawed and the conclusions overstated. We clarify this debate by replicating and refining two of the original study's most contentious benchmarks: Towers of Hanoi and River Crossing. By introducing incremental stepwise prompting and agentic collaborative dialogue, we show that previously reported failures solving the Towers of Hanoi were not purely result of output constraints, but also partly a result of cognition limitations: LRMs still stumble when complexity rises moderately (around 8 disks). Moreover, the River Crossing results initially heralded as catastrophic failures turn out to hinge upon testing unsolvable configurations. Once we limit tests strictly to solvable problems-LRMs effortlessly solve large instances involving over 100 agent pairs. Our findings ultimately defy simplistic narratives: today's LRMs are stochastic, RL-tuned searchers in a discrete state space we barely understand. Real progress in symbolic, long-horizon reasoning demands mapping that terrain through fine-grained ablations like those introduced here.",

This paper shows that a debiasing algorithm that removes information about observed confounders from the encoder representations substantially reduces these biases at a minimal computational cost. Document similarity and clustering metrics improve across every embedding variant and task we evaluate -- often dramatically. Interestingly, performance on out-of-distribution benchmarks is not impacted, indicating that the embeddings are not otherwise degraded.",

For this purpose, Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) with an eight-qubit ZZ feature map and a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) using a Tree Tensor Network ansatz and an eight-qubit ZZ feature map, were developed on Pennylane. The dataset consists of SCR measurements along with features such as the response amplitude and elapsed time, which have been categorized into amplitude-based classes. The QSVM achieved good training accuracy, but had an overfitting problem, showing a low test accuracy of 45% and therefore impacting the reliability of the classification model. The QNN model reached a higher test accuracy of 55%, making it a better classification model than the QSVM and the classic versions.",

Our approach is to develop an open-source, full-stack architecture for platform development that supports ease of distribution and cloning, generativity, and a variety of hosting options. The architecture consists of a meta-platform that is used to instantiate a base platform with supporting libraries for generic functions, and plugins (intended to be supplied by third parties) for customisation of application-specification functionality for self-organised social coordination. Associated developer- and user-oriented toolchains support the instantiation and customisation of a platform in a two-stage process. This is demonstrated through the proof-of-concept implementation of two case studies: a platform for regular sporting association, and a platform for collective group study. We conclude by arguing that self-organisation at the application layer can be achieved by the specific supporting functionality of a full-stack architecture with complimentary developer and user toolchains.",

However, their effectiveness is increasingly being questioned, particularly in large-scale applications where empirical evidence suggests potential performance limitations. In response, this paper proposes a stochastic conjugate subgradient method together with adaptive sampling tailored specifically for training LLMs. The method not only achieves faster convergence per iteration but also demonstrates improved scalability compared to traditional SGD techniques. It leverages sample complexity analysis to adaptively choose the sample size, employs a stochastic conjugate subgradient approach to determine search directions and utilizing an AdamW-like algorithm to adaptively adjust step sizes. This approach preserves the key advantages of first-order methods while effectively addressing the nonconvexity and non-smoothness inherent in LLMs training. Additionally, we provide a detailed analysis of the advantage of the algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method not only maintains, but in many cases surpasses, the scalability of traditional SGD techniques, significantly enhancing both the speed and accuracy of the optimization process.",

However, directly training policies to simultaneously handle dual extreme challenges, i.e., extreme underactuation and extreme terrains, as in monopedal hopping tasks, remains highly challenging due to unstable early-stage interactions and unreliable reward feedback. To address this, we propose JumpER (jump-start reinforcement learning via self-evolving priors), an RL training framework that structures policy learning into multiple stages of increasing complexity. By dynamically generating self-evolving priors through iterative bootstrapping of previously learned policies, JumpER progressively refines and enhances guidance, thereby stabilizing exploration and policy optimization without relying on external expert priors or handcrafted reward shaping. Specifically, when integrated with a structured three-stage curriculum that incrementally evolves action modality, observation space, and task objective, JumpER enables quadruped robots to achieve robust monopedal hopping on unpredictable terrains for the first time. Remarkably, the resulting policy effectively handles challenging scenarios that traditional methods struggle to conquer, including wide gaps up to 60 cm, irregularly spaced stairs, and stepping stones with distances varying from 15 cm to 35 cm. JumpER thus provides a principled and scalable approach for addressing locomotion tasks under the dual challenges of extreme underactuation and extreme terrains.",

To address this, we introduce the Probabilistic Visibility Graph (PVG), a novel approach inspired by the quantum tunnelling phenomenon. The PVG extends the classical Visibility Graph (VG) by introducing probabilistic connections between time points that are obstructed in the VG due to intermediate values. We demonstrate the PVG's effectiveness in capturing long-range dependencies through simulations of amplitude-modulated signals and analysis of electrocorticography (ECoG) data under rest and anesthesia conditions. Key results show that the PVG presents distinct network properties between rest and anesthesia, with rest exhibiting stronger small-worldness and scale-free behavior, reflecting a hub-dominated, centralized connectivity structure, compared to anesthesia. These findings highlight the PVG's potential for analyzing complex signals with interacting temporal scales, offering new insights into neural dynamics and other real-world phenomena.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal MRI provides critical complementary information for accurate brain tumor segmentation. However, conventional methods struggle when certain modalities are missing due to issues such as image quality, protocol inconsistencies, patient allergies, or financial constraints. To address this, we propose a robust single-modality parallel processing framework that achieves high segmentation accuracy even with incomplete modalities. Leveraging Holder divergence and mutual information, our model maintains modality-specific features while dynamically adjusting network parameters based on the available inputs. By using these divergence- and information-based loss functions, the framework effectively quantifies discrepancies between predictions and ground-truth labels, resulting in consistently accurate segmentation. Extensive evaluations on the BraTS 2018 and BraTS 2020 datasets demonstrate superior performance over existing methods in handling missing modalities.",

      "abstract": "The rapid advancement of AI-generated video models has created a pressing need for robust and interpretable evaluation frameworks. Existing metrics are limited to producing numerical scores without explanatory comments, resulting in low interpretability and human evaluation alignment. To address those challenges, we introduce AIGVE-MACS, a unified model for AI-Generated Video Evaluation(AIGVE), which can provide not only numerical scores but also multi-aspect language comment feedback in evaluating these generated videos. Central to our approach is AIGVE-BENCH 2, a large-scale benchmark comprising 2,500 AI-generated videos and 22,500 human-annotated detailed comments and numerical scores across nine critical evaluation aspects. Leveraging AIGVE-BENCH 2, AIGVE-MACS incorporates recent Vision-Language Models with a novel token-wise weighted loss and a dynamic frame sampling strategy to better align with human evaluators. Comprehensive experiments across supervised and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that AIGVE-MACS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both scoring correlation and comment quality, significantly outperforming prior baselines including GPT-4o and VideoScore. In addition, we further showcase a multi-agent refinement framework where feedback from AIGVE-MACS drives iterative improvements in video generation, leading to 53.5% quality enhancement. This work establishes a new paradigm for comprehensive, human-aligned evaluation of AI-generated videos. We release the AIGVE-BENCH 2 and AIGVE-MACS at https://huggingface.co/xiaoliux/AIGVE-MACS.",

In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for few-shot code generation to automatically synthesize driving scenarios within the CARLA simulator, which has flexibility in scenario scripting, efficient code-based control of traffic participants, and enforcement of realistic physical dynamics. Given a few example prompts and code samples, the LLM generates safety-critical scenario scripts that specify the behavior and placement of traffic participants, with a particular focus on collision events. To bridge the gap between simulation and real-world appearance, we integrate a video generation pipeline using Cosmos-Transfer1 with ControlNet, which converts rendered scenes into realistic driving videos. Our approach enables controllable scenario generation and facilitates the creation of rare but critical edge cases, such as pedestrian crossings under occlusion or sudden vehicle cut-ins. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating a wide range of realistic, diverse, and safety-critical scenarios, offering a promising tool for simulation-based testing of autonomous vehicles.",

      "abstract": "The Shapley value is widely used for data valuation in data markets. However, explaining the Shapley value of an owner in a data coalition is an unexplored and challenging task. To tackle this, we formulate the problem of finding the counterfactual explanation of Shapley value in data coalitions. Essentially, given two data owners $A$ and $B$ such that $A$ has a higher Shapley value than $B$, a counterfactual explanation is a smallest subset of data entries in $A$ such that transferring the subset from $A$ to $B$ makes the Shapley value of $A$ less than that of $B$. We show that counterfactual explanations always exist, but finding an exact counterfactual explanation is NP-hard. Using Monte Carlo estimation to approximate counterfactual explanations directly according to the definition is still very costly, since we have to estimate the Shapley values of owners $A$ and $B$ after each possible subset shift. We develop a series of heuristic techniques to speed up computation by estimating differential Shapley values, computing the power of singular data entries, and shifting subsets greedily, culminating in the SV-Exp algorithm. Our experimental results on real datasets clearly demonstrate the efficiency of our method and the effectiveness of counterfactuals in interpreting the Shapley value of an owner.",

      "abstract": "Weed mapping plays a critical role in precision management by providing accurate and timely data on weed distribution, enabling targeted control and reduced herbicide use. This minimizes environmental impacts, supports sustainable land management, and improves outcomes across agricultural and natural environments. Recent advances in weed mapping leverage ground-vehicle Red Green Blue (RGB) cameras, satellite and drone-based remote sensing combined with sensors such as spectral, Near Infra-Red (NIR), and thermal cameras. The resulting data are processed using advanced techniques including big data analytics and machine learning, significantly improving the spatial and temporal resolution of weed maps and enabling site-specific management decisions. Despite a growing body of research in this domain, there is a lack of comprehensive literature reviews specifically focused on weed mapping. In particular, the absence of a structured analysis spanning the entire mapping pipeline, from data acquisition to processing techniques and mapping tools, limits progress in the field. This review addresses these gaps by systematically examining state-of-the-art methods in data acquisition (sensor and platform technologies), data processing (including annotation and modelling), and mapping techniques (such as spatiotemporal analysis and decision support tools). Following PRISMA guidelines, we critically evaluate and synthesize key findings from the literature to provide a holistic understanding of the weed mapping landscape. This review serves as a foundational reference to guide future research and support the development of efficient, scalable, and sustainable weed management systems.",

While several unlearning benchmarks have been established for LLMs, a practical evaluation framework for unlearning in LMMs has been less explored. Specifically, existing unlearning benchmark for LMMs considers only scenarios in which the model is required to unlearn fine-tuned knowledge through a single unlearning operation. In this study, we introduce PULSE protocol for realistic unlearning scenarios for LMMs by introducing two critical perspectives: (i) Pre-trained knowledge Unlearning for analyzing the effect across different knowledge acquisition phases and (ii) Long-term Sustainability Evaluation to address sequential requests. We then evaluate existing unlearning methods along these dimensions. Our results reveal that, although some techniques can successfully unlearn knowledge acquired through fine-tuning, they struggle to eliminate information learned during pre-training. Moreover, methods that effectively unlearn a batch of target data in a single operation exhibit substantial performance degradation when the same data are split and unlearned sequentially.",

For the Glob converter, we introduce segment-boundary separation, implement Cox's flattened search strategy, and develop optimized braced condition handling to prevent exponential backtracking. Comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate that our JSON parser achieves processing speeds up to 125 MB/s on complex documents, consistently outperforming dkjson and showing competitive results against rxi_json across most test cases. Our Glob-to-LPeg converter exhibits 14-92% better performance than Bun.Glob and runs 3-14 times faster than Minimatch across diverse pattern matching scenarios.

The system integrates AI techniques, including visual focus determination using eye tracking, pupil dilation analysis, and computer vision; communication analysis through a maritime-specific speech-to-text model and natural language processing; communication correctness using large language models; and mental stress detection via vocal pitch. Models were evaluated on data from simulated maritime scenarios with seafarers exposed to controlled high-stress events. The AI algorithms achieved high accuracy, with ~92% for visual detection, ~91% for maritime speech recognition, and ~90% for stress detection, surpassing existing benchmarks. The system provides insights into visual attention, adherence to communication checklists, and stress levels under demanding conditions. This study demonstrates how AI can transform maritime training by delivering objective performance analytics, enabling personalized feedback, and improving preparedness for real-world operational challenges.",

      "abstract": "Unpaired image dehazing has attracted increasing attention due to its flexible data requirements during model training. Dominant methods based on contrastive learning not only introduce haze-unrelated content information, but also ignore haze-specific properties in the frequency domain (\\ie,~haze-related degradation is mainly manifested in the amplitude spectrum). To address these issues, we propose a novel frequency domain-based diffusion model, named \\ours, for fully exploiting the beneficial knowledge in unpaired clear data. In particular, inspired by the strong generative ability shown by Diffusion Models (DMs), we tackle the dehazing task from the perspective of frequency domain reconstruction and perform the DMs to yield the amplitude spectrum consistent with the distribution of clear images. To implement it, we propose an Amplitude Residual Encoder (ARE) to extract the amplitude residuals, which effectively compensates for the amplitude gap from the hazy to clear domains, as well as provide supervision for the DMs training. In addition, we propose a Phase Correction Module (PCM) to eliminate artifacts by further refining the phase spectrum during dehazing with a simple attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that our \\ours outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.",

This study evaluated GPT-4's ability to interpret structured textual descriptions of retinal fundus photographs and simulate clinical decisions for diabetic retinopathy (DR) and glaucoma screening, including the impact of adding real or synthetic clinical metadata. We conducted a retrospective diagnostic validation study using 300 annotated fundus images. GPT-4 received structured prompts describing each image, with or without patient metadata. The model was tasked with assigning an ICDR severity score, recommending DR referral, and estimating the cup-to-disc ratio for glaucoma referral. Performance was evaluated using accuracy, macro and weighted F1 scores, and Cohen's kappa. McNemar's test and change rate analysis were used to assess the influence of metadata. GPT-4 showed moderate performance for ICDR classification (accuracy 67.5%, macro F1 0.33, weighted F1 0.67, kappa 0.25), driven mainly by correct identification of normal cases. Performance improved in the binary DR referral task (accuracy 82.3%, F1 0.54, kappa 0.44). For glaucoma referral, performance was poor across all settings (accuracy ~78%, F1 <0.04, kappa <0.03). Metadata inclusion did not significantly affect outcomes (McNemar p > 0.05), and predictions remained consistent across conditions. GPT-4 can simulate basic ophthalmic decision-making from structured prompts but lacks precision for complex tasks. While not suitable for clinical use, LLMs may assist in education, documentation, or image annotation workflows in ophthalmology.",

Yet despite dazzling benchmark scores, LLM assistants have yet to deliver measurable improvements at the bedside. This scoping review aims to highlight the areas where AI is limited to make practical contributions in the clinical setting, specifically in dementia diagnosis and care.\n  Standalone machine-learning models excel at pattern recognition but seldom provide actionable, interpretable guidance, eroding clinician trust. Adjacent use of LLMs by physicians did not result in better diagnostic accuracy or speed. Key limitations trace to the data-driven paradigm: black-box outputs which lack transparency, vulnerability to hallucinations, and weak causal reasoning. Hybrid approaches that combine statistical learning with expert rule-based knowledge, and involve clinicians throughout the process help bring back interpretability. They also fit better with existing clinical workflows, as seen in examples like PEIRS and ATHENA-CDS.\n  Future decision-support should prioritise explanatory coherence by linking predictions to clinically meaningful causes. This can be done through neuro-symbolic or hybrid AI that combines the language ability of LLMs with human causal expertise. AI researchers have addressed this direction, with explainable AI and neuro-symbolic AI being the next logical steps in further advancement in AI. However, they are still based on data-driven knowledge integration instead of human-in-the-loop approaches. Future research should measure success not only by accuracy but by improvements in clinician understanding, workflow fit, and patient outcomes. A better understanding of what helps improve human-computer interactions is greatly needed for AI systems to become part of clinical practice.",

While federated learning enables personalized recommendations without exposing raw user data, existing aggregation methods overlook the unique properties of user embeddings in this setting. Indeed, traditional aggregation methods fail to account for their complexity and the critical role of user similarity in recommendation effectiveness. Moreover, evolving user interactions require adaptive aggregation while preserving the influence of high-relevance anchor users (the primary users before expansion in graph-based frameworks). To address these limitations, we introduce Dist-FedAvg, a novel distance-based aggregation method designed to enhance personalization and aggregation efficiency in graph federated learning. Our method assigns higher aggregation weights to users with similar embeddings, while ensuring that anchor users retain significant influence in local updates. Empirical evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that Dist-FedAvg consistently outperforms baseline aggregation techniques, improving recommendation accuracy while maintaining seamless integration into existing federated learning frameworks.",

In such a UAV-assisted network, this paper investigates position-based beamforming between ABSs and ground users (GUs). To mitigate inter-cell interference, we propose a novel fluid aerial network that leverages ABS rotation to increase multi-cell capacity and overall network efficiency. Specifically, considering the line-of-sight channel model, the spatial beamforming weights are determined by the orientation angles of the GUs. In this direction, we examine the beamforming gain of a two-dimensional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) array at various ground positions, revealing that ABS rotation significantly affects multi-user channel correlation and inter-cell interference. Based on these findings, we propose an alternative low-complexity algorithm to design the optimal rotation angle for ABSs, aiming to reduce inter-cell interference and thus maximize the sum rate of multi-cell systems. In simulations, exhaustive search serves as a benchmark to validate the optimization performance of the proposed sequential ABS rotation scheme. Moreover, simulation results demonstrate that, in interference-limited regions, the proposed ABS rotation paradigm can significantly reduce inter-cell interference in terrestrial networks and improve the multi-cell sum rate by approximately 10\\% compared to fixed-direction ABSs without rotation.",

      "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has primarily been studied in limited settings, such as factoid question answering; more challenging, reasoning-intensive benchmarks have seen limited success from minimal RAG. In this work, we challenge this prevailing view on established, reasoning-intensive benchmarks: MMLU, MMLU Pro, AGI Eval, GPQA, and MATH. We identify a key missing component in prior work: a usable, web-scale datastore aligned with the breadth of pretraining data. To this end, we introduce CompactDS: a diverse, high-quality, web-scale datastore that achieves high retrieval accuracy and subsecond latency on a single-node. The key insights are (1) most web content can be filtered out without sacrificing coverage, and a compact, high-quality subset is sufficient; and (2) combining in-memory approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) retrieval and on-disk exact search balances speed and recall. Using CompactDS, we show that a minimal RAG pipeline achieves consistent accuracy improvements across all benchmarks and model sizes (8B--70B), with relative gains of 10% on MMLU, 33% on MMLU Pro, 14% on GPQA, and 19% on MATH. No single data source suffices alone, highlighting the importance of diversity of sources (web crawls, curated math, academic papers, textbooks). Finally, we show that our carefully designed in-house datastore matches or outperforms web search engines such as Google Search, as well as recently proposed, complex agent-based RAG systems--all while maintaining simplicity, reproducibility, and self-containment. We release CompactDS and our retrieval pipeline, supporting future research exploring retrieval-based AI systems.",

Existing methods face limitations, either demanding time-consuming recovery training that hinders real-world adoption, or relying on empirical magnitude-based pruning, which causes fluctuating sparsity and unstable inference speed-up. This paper introduces LaRoSA (Layerwise Rotated Sparse Activation), a novel method for activation sparsification designed to improve LLM efficiency without requiring additional training or magnitude-based pruning. We leverage layerwise orthogonal rotations to transform input activations into rotated forms that are more suitable for sparsification. By employing a Top-K selection approach within the rotated activations, we achieve consistent model-level sparsity and reliable wall-clock time speed-up. LaRoSA is effective across various sizes and types of LLMs, demonstrating minimal performance degradation and robust inference acceleration. Specifically, for LLaMA2-7B at 40% sparsity, LaRoSA achieves a mere 0.17 perplexity gap with a consistent 1.30x wall-clock time speed-up, and reduces the accuracy gap in zero-shot tasks compared to the dense model to just 0.54%, while surpassing TEAL by 1.77% and CATS by 17.14%.",

However, the dynamic performance of GFL models can be significantly impacted by the Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) in a weak grid, leading to instability due to inaccuracies in grid source phase angle estimation. The proposed method in this manuscript replaces the PLL with an Advanced Angle Estimation based Kalman Filter including a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller of the GFL. This method is robust in incorporating grid impedance terms as part of state space models in the Kalman Filter approach to estimate instantaneous phase angle using {\\alpha}-\\b{eta} Synchronous Reference Frame equations. The stability performance of the proposed approach is validated through eigenvalue analysis in a two-source case. Additionally, an LQR controller is employed to regulate capacitor voltage, inverter current, and the current at the Point of Common Coupling (PCC). The proposed controller surpasses existing approaches in terms of accuracy and distortion reduction under abrupt grid impedance increases. Moreover, drop compensation is integrated into the Kalman Filter to enhance robustness of the inverter against external oscillation disturbances from a synchronous machine connected to the GFL via the PCC. The results in this paper demonstrate substantial improvement in oscillation damping across a range of frequencies compared with published research works.",

Powerful ethical frameworks exist to minimize these issues, but are often developed for academic or regulatory environments and tend to be comprehensive but overly prescriptive, making them difficult to operationalize within fast-paced, resource-constrained environments. We introduce the Scalable Agile Framework for Execution in AI (SAFE-AI) designed to balance ethical rigor with business priorities by embedding ethical oversight into standard Agile-based product development workflows. The framework emphasizes the early establishment of testable acceptance criteria, fairness metrics, and transparency metrics to manage model uncertainty, while also promoting continuous monitoring and re-evaluation of these metrics across the AI lifecycle. A core component of this framework are responsibility metrics using scenario-based probability analogy mapping designed to enhance transparency and stakeholder trust. This ensures that retraining or tuning activities are subject to lightweight but meaningful ethical review. By focusing on the minimum necessary requirements for responsible development, our framework offers a scalable, business-aligned approach to ethical AI suitable for organizations without dedicated ethics teams.",

      "abstract": "We introduce a simple yet effective technique for estimating lighting from a single low-dynamic-range (LDR) image by reframing the task as a chrome ball inpainting problem. This approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model, Stable Diffusion XL, to overcome the generalization failures of existing methods that rely on limited HDR panorama datasets. While conceptually simple, the task remains challenging because diffusion models often insert incorrect or inconsistent content and cannot readily generate chrome balls in HDR format. Our analysis reveals that the inpainting process is highly sensitive to the initial noise in the diffusion process, occasionally resulting in unrealistic outputs. To address this, we first introduce DiffusionLight, which uses iterative inpainting to compute a median chrome ball from multiple outputs to serve as a stable, low-frequency lighting prior that guides the generation of a high-quality final result. To generate high-dynamic-range (HDR) light probes, an Exposure LoRA is fine-tuned to create LDR images at multiple exposure values, which are then merged. While effective, DiffusionLight is time-intensive, requiring approximately 30 minutes per estimation. To reduce this overhead, we introduce DiffusionLight-Turbo, which reduces the runtime to about 30 seconds with minimal quality loss. This 60x speedup is achieved by training a Turbo LoRA to directly predict the averaged chrome balls from the iterative process. Inference is further streamlined into a single denoising pass using a LoRA swapping technique. Experimental results that show our method produces convincing light estimates across diverse settings and demonstrates superior generalization to in-the-wild scenarios.

Most of the current designs of motion prediction models are based on the major representation of lane centerlines, which limits their capability to capture critical road environments and traffic rules and constraints. In this work, we propose an enhanced motion forecasting model informed by multiple vector map elements, including lane boundaries and road edges, that facilitates a richer and more complete representation of driving environments. An effective feature fusion strategy is developed to merge information in different vector map components, where the model learns holistic information on road structures and their interactions with agents. Since encoding more information about the road environment increases memory usage and is computationally expensive, we developed an effective pruning mechanism that filters the most relevant map connections to the target agent, ensuring computational efficiency while maintaining essential spatial and semantic relationships for accurate trajectory prediction. Overcoming the limitations of lane centerline-based models, our method provides a more informative and efficient representation of the driving environment and advances the state of the art for autonomous vehicle motion forecasting. We verify our approach with extensive experiments on the Argoverse 2 motion forecasting dataset, where our method maintains competitiveness on AV2 while achieving improved performance.\n  Index Terms-Autonomous driving, trajectory prediction, vector map elements, road topology, connection pruning, Argoverse 2.",

Among them, Stable Diffusion (StableDiff) stands out as a key model for text-to-image generation and a foundation for next-generation multi-modal algorithms. However, its high computational and memory demands hinder inference speed and energy efficiency. To address these challenges, we identify three core issues: (1) intensive and often redundant computations, (2) heterogeneous operations involving convolutions and attention mechanisms, and (3) diverse weight and activation sizes.\n  We present SD-Acc, a novel algorithm and hardware co-optimization framework. At the algorithm level, we observe that high-level features in certain denoising phases show significant similarity, enabling approximate computation. Leveraging this, we propose an adaptive, phase-aware sampling strategy that reduces compute and memory loads. This framework automatically balances image quality and complexity based on the StableDiff model and user requirements. At the hardware level, we design an address-centric dataflow to efficiently handle heterogeneous operations within a simple systolic array. We address the bottleneck of nonlinear functions via a two-stage streaming architecture and a reconfigurable vector processing unit. Additionally, we implement adaptive dataflow optimizations by combining dynamic reuse and operator fusion tailored to StableDiff workloads, significantly reducing memory access. Across multiple StableDiff models, our method achieves up to a 3x reduction in computational demand without compromising image quality. Combined with our optimized hardware accelerator, SD-Acc delivers higher speed and energy efficiency than traditional CPU and GPU implementations.",

An alternative to traditional dynamic programming is Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP), which recasts the problem as a system of Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (FBSDEs). In this paper, we introduce a formal framework for solving such problems with deep learning by defining a \\textbf{Neural Hamiltonian Operator (NHO)}. This operator parameterizes the coupled FBSDE dynamics via neural networks that represent the feedback control and an ansatz for the value function's spatial gradient. We show how the optimal NHO can be found by training the underlying networks to enforce the consistency conditions dictated by the PMP. By adopting this operator-theoretic view, we situate the deep FBSDE method within the rigorous language of statistical inference, framing it as a problem of learning an unknown operator from simulated data. This perspective allows us to prove the universal approximation capabilities of NHOs under general martingale drivers and provides a clear lens for analyzing the significant optimization challenges inherent to this class of models.",

      "abstract": "Copy-paste-modify is a widespread and pragmatic practice in software development, where developers adapt reused code snippets, sourced from platforms such as Stack Overflow, GitHub, or LLM outputs, into their local codebase. A critical yet underexplored aspect of this adaptation is code wiring, which involves substituting unresolved variables in the pasted code with suitable ones from the surrounding context. Existing solutions either rely on heuristic rules or historical templates, often failing to effectively utilize contextual information, despite studies showing that over half of adaptation cases are context-dependent. In this paper, we introduce WIRL, an LLM-based agent for code wiring framed as a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) infilling task. WIRL combines an LLM, a customized toolkit, and an orchestration module to identify unresolved variables, retrieve context, and perform context-aware substitutions. To balance efficiency and autonomy, the agent adopts a mixed strategy: deterministic rule-based steps for common patterns, and a state-machine-guided decision process for intelligent exploration. We evaluate WIRL on a carefully curated, high-quality dataset consisting of real-world code adaptation scenarios. Our approach achieves an exact match precision of 91.7% and a recall of 90.0%, outperforming advanced LLMs by 22.6 and 13.7 percentage points in precision and recall, respectively, and surpassing IntelliJ IDEA by 54.3 and 49.9 percentage points. These results underscore its practical utility, particularly in contexts with complex variable dependencies or multiple unresolved variables. We believe WIRL paves the way for more intelligent and context-aware developer assistance in modern IDEs.",

This paper, for the first time, investigates the multi-generation issue in learned point cloud attribute compression. We identify two primary factors contributing to quality degradation in multi-generation compression: quantization-induced non-idempotency and transformation irreversibility. To address the former, we propose a Mapping Idempotency Constraint, that enables the network to learn the complete compression-decompression mapping, enhancing its robustness to repeated processes. To address the latter, we introduce a Transformation Reversibility Constraint, which preserves reversible information flow via a quantization-free training path. Further, we propose a Latent Variable Consistency Constraint which enhances the multi-generation compression robustness by incorporating a decompression-compression cross-generation path and a latent variable consistency loss term. Extensive experiments conducted on the Owlii and 8iVFB datasets verify that the proposed methods can effectively suppress multi-generation loss while maintaining single-pass rate-distortion performance comparable to baseline models.",

However, it also introduces a critical vulnerability to backdoor attacks, where adversaries can manipulate LLM behaviors by simply poisoning a few ICL demonstrations. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, the dual-learning hypothesis, which posits that LLMs simultaneously learn both the task-relevant latent concepts and backdoor latent concepts within poisoned demonstrations, jointly influencing the probability of model outputs. Through theoretical analysis, we derive an upper bound for ICL backdoor effects, revealing that the vulnerability is dominated by the concept preference ratio between the task and the backdoor. Motivated by these findings, we propose ICLShield, a defense mechanism that dynamically adjusts the concept preference ratio. Our method encourages LLMs to select clean demonstrations during the ICL phase by leveraging confidence and similarity scores, effectively mitigating susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and tasks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art defense effectiveness, significantly outperforming existing approaches (+26.02% on average). Furthermore, our method exhibits exceptional adaptability and defensive performance even for closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4).",

In this work, we propose a novel Adaptive Perplexity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (APARL) framework that leverages the advanced reasoning capabilities of large language models for abnormal event detection. APARL introduces a dual-loop dynamic curriculum learning architecture, enabling the model to progressively focus on more challenging samples as its proficiency increases.

Extensive evaluations on food delivery dialogue tasks show that our model achieves significantly enhanced adaptability and robustness, attaining the highest F1 score with an average improvement of 17.19\\%, and an average improvement of 9.59\\% in OOD transfer tests.

      "abstract": "Coded computing is a reliable and fault-tolerant mechanism for implementing large computing tasks over a distributed set of worker nodes. While a majority of coded computing frameworks address accurate computation of the target functions, they are restricted to computing multivariate polynomial functions. To generalize these computing platforms to non-polynomial target functions, Jahani-Nezhad and Maddah-Ali recently proposed Berrut Approximated Coded computing (BACC), which was proven fault-tolerant against stragglers albiet with tolerable approximation errors on the target functions. Despite these benefits, there is no formal study on the security of BACC against worker nodes which report erroneous computations. To fill this research gap, we use a coding-theoretic approach to propose Secure Berrut Approximated Coded Computing (SBACC), which is resilient to stragglers and also robust to the presence of such untrusted worker nodes. One of the highlights of SBACC is the new choice of evaluation points for distributed computation which makes the well-known Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) codes amenable to error detection and correction. To validate the new choice of evaluation points, first, we derive bounds on the accuracy of SBACC in the absence of untrusted worker nodes. Subsequently, to handle the presence of untrusted worker nodes, we derive bounds on the accuracy of SBACC and show that interesting optimization problems can be formulated to study the trade-off between the error correcting capability of the DCT codes and the accuracy of the target computation.",

In the framework, we construct an intent-aware shared knowledge base (SKB) that incorporates prior knowledge of semantic information (SI) and user-specific preferences. Then, we designate the common SI as a one-hot semantic map that is broadcast to all users, while the private SI is delivered as personalized text for each user. On the receiver side, a diffusion model enhanced with ControlNet is adopted to generate high-quality personalized images. To capture both semantic relevance and perceptual similarity, we design a novel semantic efficiency score (SES) metric as the optimization objective. Building on this, we formulate a joint optimization problem for multi-user semantic extraction and beamforming, solved using a reinforcement learning-based algorithm due to its robustness in high-dimensional settings. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal fingerprinting is a crucial technique to sub-meter 6G integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) localization, but two hurdles block deployment: (i) the contribution each modality makes to the target position varies with the operating conditions such as carrier frequency, and (ii) spatial and fingerprint ambiguities markedly undermine localization accuracy, especially in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. To solve these problems, we introduce SCADF-MoE, a spatial-context aware dynamic fusion network built on a soft mixture-of-experts backbone. SCADF-MoE first clusters neighboring points into short trajectories to inject explicit spatial context. Then, it adaptively fuses channel state information, angle of arrival profile, distance, and gain through its learnable MoE router, so that the most reliable cues dominate at each carrier band. The fused representation is fed to a modality-task MoE that simultaneously regresses the coordinates of every vertex in the trajectory and its centroid, thereby exploiting inter-point correlations. Finally, an auxiliary maximum-mean-discrepancy loss enforces expert diversity and mitigates gradient interference, stabilizing multi-task training. On three real urban layouts and three carrier bands (2.6, 6, 28 GHz), the model delivers consistent sub-meter MSE and halves unseen-NLOS error versus the best prior work. To our knowledge, this is the first work that leverages large-scale multimodal MoE for frequency-robust ISAC localization.",

      "abstract": "Music source separation (MSS) aims to extract individual instrument sources from their mixture. While most existing methods focus on the widely adopted four-stem separation setup (vocals, bass, drums, and other instruments), this approach lacks the flexibility needed for real-world applications. To address this, we propose GuideSep, a diffusion-based MSS model capable of instrument-agnostic separation beyond the four-stem setup. GuideSep is conditioned on multiple inputs: a waveform mimicry condition, which can be easily provided by humming or playing the target melody, and mel-spectrogram domain masks, which offer additional guidance for separation. Unlike prior approaches that relied on fixed class labels or sound queries, our conditioning scheme, coupled with the generative approach, provides greater flexibility and applicability. Additionally, we design a mask-prediction baseline using the same model architecture to systematically compare predictive and generative approaches. Our objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that GuideSep achieves high-quality separation while enabling more versatile instrument extraction, highlighting the potential of user participation in the diffusion-based generative process for MSS.

Modern approaches collect the body dynamics, external reactive force specifically, via force plates, synchronizing with human motion capture data, and learn to estimate the dynamics from a black-box deep learning model. Being specialized devices, force plates can only be installed in laboratory setups, imposing a significant limitation on the learning of human dynamics. To this end, we propose a novel method for estimating human ground reaction dynamics directly from the more reliable motion capture data with physics laws and computational simulation as constrains. We introduce a highly accurate and robust method for computing ground reaction forces from motion capture data using Euler's integration scheme and PD algorithm. The physics-based reactive forces are used to inform the learning model about the physics-informed motion dynamics thus improving the estimation accuracy. The proposed approach was tested on the GroundLink dataset, outperforming the baseline model on: 1) the ground reaction force estimation accuracy compared to the force plates measurement; and 2) our simulated root trajectory precision.

      "abstract": "The image signal processor (ISP) pipeline in modern cameras consists of several modules that transform raw sensor data into visually pleasing images in a display color space. Among these, the auto white balance (AWB) module is essential for compensating for scene illumination. However, commercial AWB systems often strive to compute aesthetic white-balance preferences rather than accurate neutral color correction. While learning-based methods have improved AWB accuracy, they typically struggle to generalize across different camera sensors -- an issue for smartphones with multiple cameras. Recent work has explored cross-camera AWB, but most methods remain focused on achieving neutral white balance. In contrast, this paper is the first to address aesthetic consistency by learning a post-illuminant-estimation mapping that transforms neutral illuminant corrections into aesthetically preferred corrections in a camera-agnostic space. Once trained, our mapping can be applied after any neutral AWB module to enable consistent and stylized color rendering across unseen cameras. Our proposed model is lightweight -- containing only $\\sim$500 parameters -- and runs in just 0.024 milliseconds on a typical flagship mobile CPU. Evaluated on a dataset of 771 smartphone images from three different cameras, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while remaining fully compatible with existing cross-camera AWB techniques, introducing minimal computational and memory overhead.",

By applying a new general data transformation, that randomly perturbs multiple times the PCA subspace projection of a test input, GTTA forms robust ensembles at test time in which, due to sound statistical properties, the structural and systematic noises in the initial input data is filtered out and final estimator errors are reduced. Different from other existing methods, we also propose a final self-supervised learning stage in which the ensemble output, acting as an unsupervised teacher, is used to train the initial single student model, thus reducing significantly the test time computational cost, at no loss in accuracy. Our tests and comparisons to strong TTA approaches and SoTA models on various vision and non-vision well-known datasets and tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, speech recognition and house price prediction, validate the generality of the proposed GTTA. Furthermore, we also prove its effectiveness on the more specific real-world task of salmon segmentation and detection in low-visibility underwater videos, for which we introduce DeepSalmon, the largest dataset of its kind in the literature.",

We specifically focus on scenarios when the interceptors lack radial acceleration capabilities, relying solely on their lateral acceleration components. This consideration aligns with their inherent kinematic turn constraints. The proposed strategy explicitly addresses the complexities of coupled 3D engagements, thereby mitigating performance degradation that typically arises when the pitch and yaw channels are decoupled into two separate, mutually orthogonal planar engagements. Moreover, our formulation incorporates modeling uncertainties associated with the time-to-go estimation into the derivation of cooperative guidance commands to ensure robustness against inaccuracies in dynamic engagement scenarios. To optimize control efficiency, we analytically derive the lateral acceleration components in the orthogonal pitch and yaw channels by solving an instantaneous optimization problem, subject to an affine constraint. We show that the proposed cooperative guidance commands guarantee consensus in time-to-go values within a predefined time, which can be prescribed as a design parameter, regardless of the interceptors' initial configurations. We provide simulations to attest to the efficacy of the proposed method.",

Existing MoE frameworks for LVLMs focus on token-to-expert routing (TER), encouraging different experts to specialize in processing distinct tokens. However, these frameworks often rely on the load balancing mechanism, overlooking the inherent distributional differences between vision and language. To this end, we propose a Long-Tailed Distribution-aware Router (LTDR) for vision-language TER, tackling two challenges: (1) Distribution-aware router for modality-specific routing. We observe that language TER follows a uniform distribution, whereas vision TER exhibits a long-tailed distribution. This discrepancy necessitates distinct routing strategies tailored to each modality. (2) Enhancing expert activation for vision tail tokens. Recognizing the importance of vision tail tokens, we introduce an oversampling-like strategy by increasing the number of activated experts for these tokens. Experiments on extensive benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach.",

      "abstract": "Despite the critical role of reward models (RMs) in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), current state-of-the-art open RMs perform poorly on most existing evaluation benchmarks, failing to capture the spectrum of nuanced and sophisticated human preferences. Even approaches that incorporate advanced training techniques have not yielded meaningful performance improvements. We hypothesize that this brittleness stems primarily from limitations in preference datasets, which are often narrowly scoped, synthetically labeled, or lack rigorous quality control. To address these challenges, we present a large-scale preference dataset comprising 40 million preference pairs, named SynPref-40M. To enable data curation at scale, we design a human-AI synergistic two-stage pipeline that leverages the complementary strengths of human annotation quality and AI scalability. In this pipeline, humans provide verified annotations, while large language models perform automatic curation based on human guidance. Training on this preference mixture, we introduce Skywork-Reward-V2, a suite of eight reward models ranging from 0.6B to 8B parameters, trained on a carefully curated subset of 26 million preference pairs from SynPref-40M. We demonstrate that Skywork-Reward-V2 is versatile across a wide range of capabilities, including alignment with human preferences, objective correctness, safety, resistance to stylistic biases, and best-of-N scaling, achieving state-of-the-art performance across seven major reward model benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm that the effectiveness of our approach stems not only from data scale but also from high-quality curation. The Skywork-Reward-V2 series represents substantial progress in open reward models, highlighting the untapped potential of existing preference datasets and demonstrating how human-AI curation synergy can unlock significantly higher data quality.",

To efficiently multiplex sensor data, mmBack designs a voltage-division scheme to multiplex multiple sensor inputs as backscatter frequency shifts through a single oscillator and RF switch. At the receiver, mmBack develops a frequency tracking algorithm and a finite-state machine for accurate demultiplexing. mmBack's ASIC design consumes 25.56uW, while its prototype supports 5 concurrent sensor streams with bandwidths of up to 5kHz and 3 concurrent sensor streams with bandwidth of up to 18kHz.

      "abstract": "We study (s,t)-cuts of second minimum capacity and present the following algorithmic and graph-theoretic results.\n  1. Vazirani and Yannakakis [ICALP 1992] designed the first algorithm for computing an (s,t)-cut of second minimum capacity using $O(n^2)$ maximum (s,t)-flow computations. For directed integer-weighted graphs, we significantly improve this bound by designing an algorithm that computes an $(s,t)$-cut of second minimum capacity using $O(\\sqrt{n})$ maximum (s,t)-flow computations w.h.p. To achieve this result, a close relationship of independent interest is established between $(s,t)$-cuts of second minimum capacity and global mincuts in directed weighted graphs.\n  2. Minimum+1 (s,t)-cuts have been studied quite well recently [Baswana, Bhanja, and Pandey, ICALP 2022], which is a special case of second (s,t)-mincut.\n  (a) For directed multi-graphs, we design an algorithm that, given any maximum (s,t)-flow, computes a minimum+1 (s,t)-cut, if it exists, in $O(m)$ time.\n  (b) The existing structures for storing and characterizing all minimum+1 (s,t)-cuts occupy $O(mn)$ space. For undirected multi-graphs, we design a DAG occupying only $O(m)$ space that stores and characterizes all minimum+1 (s,t)-cuts.\n  3. The study of minimum+1 (s,t)-cuts often turns out to be useful in designing dual edge sensitivity oracles -- a compact data structure for efficiently reporting an (s,t)-mincut after insertion/failure of any given pair of query edges. It has been shown recently [Bhanja, ICALP 2025] that any dual edge sensitivity oracle for (s,t)-mincut in undirected multi-graphs must occupy ${\\Omega}(n^2)$ space in the worst-case, irrespective of the query time. For simple graphs, we break this quadratic barrier while achieving a non-trivial query time.",

      "abstract": "Physical adversarial attack methods expose the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks and pose a significant threat to safety-critical scenarios such as autonomous driving. Camouflage-based physical attack is a more promising approach compared to the patch-based attack, offering stronger adversarial effectiveness in complex physical environments. However, most prior work relies on mesh priors of the target object and virtual environments constructed by simulators, which are time-consuming to obtain and inevitably differ from the real world. Moreover, due to the limitations of the backgrounds in training images, previous methods often fail to produce multi-view robust adversarial camouflage and tend to fall into sub-optimal solutions. Due to these reasons, prior work lacks adversarial effectiveness and robustness across diverse viewpoints and physical environments. We propose a physical attack framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), named PGA, which provides rapid and precise reconstruction with few images, along with photo-realistic rendering capabilities. Our framework further enhances cross-view robustness and adversarial effectiveness by preventing mutual and self-occlusion among Gaussians and employing a min-max optimization approach that adjusts the imaging background of each viewpoint, helping the algorithm filter out non-robust adversarial features. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of PGA. Our code is available at:https://github.com/TRLou/PGA.",

A common approach is to use reward modeling to encode preferences, enabling alignment via post-training using reinforcement learning. However, traditional reward modeling is not easily adaptable to new preferences because it requires a separate reward model, commonly trained on large preference datasets. To address this, we introduce Activation Reward Models (Activation RMs) -- a novel few-shot reward modeling method that leverages activation steering to construct well-aligned reward signals using minimal supervision and no additional model finetuning. Activation RMs outperform existing few-shot reward modeling approaches such as LLM-as-a-judge with in-context learning, voting-based scoring, and token probability scoring on standard reward modeling benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Activation RMs in mitigating reward hacking behaviors, highlighting their utility for safety-critical applications. Toward this end, we propose PreferenceHack, a novel few-shot setting benchmark, the first to test reward models on reward hacking in a paired preference format. Finally, we show that Activation RM achieves state-of-the-art performance on this benchmark, surpassing even GPT-4o.",

An AI model is used to predict measurements for individual units, which are then sampled for human labeling using importance sampling. With each new set of human labels, the AI model is improved and an unbiased Monte Carlo estimate of the total measurement is refined. Active measurement can provide precise estimates even with an imperfect AI model, and requires little human effort when the AI model is very accurate.

      "abstract": "Intelligent control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) swarms has emerged as a critical research focus, and it typically requires the swarm to navigate effectively while avoiding obstacles and achieving continuous coverage over multiple mission targets. Although traditional Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approaches offer dynamic adaptability, they are hindered by the semantic gap in numerical communication and the rigidity of homogeneous role structures, resulting in poor generalization and limited task scalability. Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM)-based control frameworks demonstrate strong semantic reasoning capabilities by leveraging extensive prior knowledge. However, due to the lack of online learning and over-reliance on static priors, these works often struggle with effective exploration, leading to reduced individual potential and overall system performance. To address these limitations, we propose a Role-Adaptive LLM-Driven Yoked navigation algorithm RALLY. Specifically, we first develop an LLM-driven semantic decision framework that uses structured natural language for efficient semantic communication and collaborative reasoning. Afterward, we introduce a dynamic role-heterogeneity mechanism for adaptive role switching and personalized decision-making. Furthermore, we propose a Role-value Mixing Network (RMIX)-based assignment strategy that integrates LLM offline priors with MARL online policies to enable semi-offline training of role selection strategies. Experiments in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE) environment and a Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) platform demonstrate that RALLY outperforms conventional approaches in terms of task coverage, convergence speed, and generalization, highlighting its strong potential for collaborative navigation in agentic multi-UAV systems.",

Traditional methods typically use unimodal distributions, such as Gaussian distributions, to model the output of value distributions. However, unimodal distribution often and easily causes bias in value function estimation, leading to poor algorithm performance. This paper proposes a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm called DSAC-D (Distributed Soft Actor Critic with Diffusion Policy) to address the challenges of estimating bias in value functions and obtaining multimodal policy representations. A multimodal distributional policy iteration framework that can converge to the optimal policy was established by introducing policy entropy and value distribution function. A diffusion value network that can accurately characterize the distribution of multi peaks was constructed by generating a set of reward samples through reverse sampling using a diffusion model. Based on this, a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm with dual diffusion of the value network and the policy network was derived. MuJoCo testing tasks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only learns multimodal policy, but also achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all 9 control tasks, with significant suppression of estimation bias and total average return improvement of over 10\\% compared to existing mainstream algorithms. The results of real vehicle testing show that DSAC-D can accurately characterize the multimodal distribution of different driving styles, and the diffusion policy network can characterize multimodal trajectories.",

However, much of this work has largely overlooked the differential robustness of recommendation models. Moreover, our empirical findings indicate that existing targeted attack methods achieve only limited effectiveness in Federated Sequential Recommendation(FSR) tasks. Driven by these observations, we focus on investigating targeted attacks in FSR and propose a novel dualview attack framework, named DV-FSR. This attack method uniquely combines a sampling-based explicit strategy with a contrastive learning-based implicit gradient strategy to orchestrate a coordinated attack. Additionally, we introduce a specific defense mechanism tailored for targeted attacks in FSR, aiming to evaluate the mitigation effects of the attack method we proposed.

Despite significant progress, due to the limitations of the weakly-supervised and the deficiencies of the model architecture, existing methods are lacking in simultaneously improving both the segment-level prediction and the event-level prediction. In this work, we propose a audio-visual Mamba network with pseudo labeling aUGmentation (MUG) for emphasising the uniqueness of each segment and excluding the noise interference from the alternate modalities. Specifically, we annotate some of the pseudo-labels based on previous work. Using unimodal pseudo-labels, we perform cross-modal random combinations to generate new data, which can enhance the model's ability to parse various segment-level event combinations. For feature processing and interaction, we employ a audio-visual mamba network. The AV-Mamba enhances the ability to perceive different segments and excludes additional modal noise while sharing similar modal information. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MUG improves state-of-the-art results on LLP dataset in all metrics (e.g,, gains of 2.1% and 1.2% in terms of visual Segment-level and audio Segment-level metrics).

      "abstract": "Recently, a surrogate model was proposed that employs a factorization machine to approximate the underlying input-output mapping of the original system, with quantum annealing used to optimize the resulting surrogate function. Inspired by this approach, we propose an enhanced surrogate model that incorporates additional slack variables into both the factorization machine and its associated Ising representation thereby unifying what was by design a two-step process into a single, integrated step. During the training phase, the slack variables are iteratively updated, enabling the model to account for higher-order feature interactions. We apply the proposed method to the task of predicting drug combination effects. Experimental results indicate that the introduction of slack variables leads to a notable improvement of performance. Our algorithm offers a promising approach for building efficient surrogate models that exploit potential quantum advantages.",

      "abstract": "Talking head generation is gaining significant importance across various domains, with a growing demand for high-quality rendering. However, existing methods often suffer from identity leakage (IL) and rendering artifacts (RA), particularly in extreme cases. Through an in-depth analysis of previous approaches, we identify two key insights: (1) IL arises from identity information embedded within motion features, and (2) this identity information can be leveraged to address RA. Building on these findings, this paper introduces FixTalk, a novel framework designed to simultaneously resolve both issues for high-quality talking head generation. Firstly, we propose an Enhanced Motion Indicator (EMI) to effectively decouple identity information from motion features, mitigating the impact of IL on generated talking heads. To address RA, we introduce an Enhanced Detail Indicator (EDI), which utilizes the leaked identity information to supplement missing details, thus fixing the artifacts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FixTalk effectively mitigates IL and RA, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Most autonomous cars rely on the availability of high-definition (HD) maps. Current research aims to address this constraint by directly predicting HD map elements from onboard sensors and reasoning about the relationships between the predicted map and traffic elements. Despite recent advancements, the coherent online construction of HD maps remains a challenging endeavor, as it necessitates modeling the high complexity of road topologies in a unified and consistent manner. To address this challenge, we propose a coherent approach to predict lane segments and their corresponding topology, as well as road boundaries, all by leveraging prior map information represented by commonly available standard-definition (SD) maps. We propose a network architecture, which leverages hybrid lane segment encodings comprising prior information and denoising techniques to enhance training stability and performance. Furthermore, we facilitate past frames for temporal consistency. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach outperforms previous methods by a large margin, highlighting the benefits of our modeling scheme.",

      "abstract": "Fetal abdominal malformations are serious congenital anomalies that require accurate diagnosis to guide pregnancy management and reduce mortality. Although AI has demonstrated significant potential in medical diagnosis, its application to prenatal abdominal anomalies remains limited. Most existing studies focus on image-level classification and rely on standard plane localization, placing less emphasis on case-level diagnosis. In this paper, we develop a case-level multiple instance learning (MIL)-based method, free of standard plane localization, for classifying fetal abdominal anomalies in prenatal ultrasound. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we adopt a mixture-of-attention-experts module (MoAE) to weight different attention heads for various planes. Secondly, we propose a medical-knowledge-driven feature selection module (MFS) to align image features with medical knowledge, performing self-supervised image token selection at the case-level. Finally, we propose a prompt-based prototype learning (PPL) to enhance the MFS. Extensively validated on a large prenatal abdominal ultrasound dataset containing 2,419 cases, with a total of 24,748 images and 6 categories, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors.

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose and validate a two-species Multiscale model for a Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) system, focusing on the correlated motion of positive and negative ions under the influence of a trap. Specifically, we aim to model surface traps whose attraction range, of length delta, is much smaller then the scale of the problem. The physical setup we refer to is an anchored gas drop (bubble) surrounded by a diffusive flow of charged surfactants (ions). When the diffusing surfactants reach the surface of the trap, the anions are adsorbed. As in our previous works [11,6,9,4], the effect of the attractive potential is replaced by a suitable boundary condition derived by mass conservation and asymptotic analysis. The novelty of this work is the extension of the model proposed in [11], now incorporating the influence of both carriers - positive and negative ions - simultaneously, which is often neglected in traditional approaches that treat ion species independently. In the second part of the paper, we address the treatment of the Coulomb interaction between carriers. When the Debye length lambda_D (proportional to a small parameter epsilon) is very small, one can adopt the so-called Quasi-Neutral limit, which significantly simplifies the system, reducing it to a diffusion equation for a single carriers with effective diffusion coefficient [36,53]. This approach, while simplifying the mathematical model, does not capture the effects of non negligible values of epsilon. When the Debye length is small but not negligible, it may be very expensive to capture the small deviation from the Quasi-Neutral limit by standard methods in the literature. [...]",

      "abstract": "An image captioning model flexibly switching its language pattern, e.g., descriptiveness and length, should be useful since it can be applied to diverse applications. However, despite the dramatic improvement in generative vision-language models, fine-grained control over the properties of generated captions is not easy due to two reasons: (i) existing models are not given the properties as a condition during training and (ii) existing models cannot smoothly transition its language pattern from one state to the other. Given this challenge, we propose a new approach, CaptionSmiths, to acquire a single captioning model that can handle diverse language patterns. First, our approach quantifies three properties of each caption, length, descriptiveness, and uniqueness of a word, as continuous scalar values, without human annotation. Given the values, we represent the conditioning via interpolation between two endpoint vectors corresponding to the extreme states, e.g., one for a very short caption and one for a very long caption. Empirical results demonstrate that the resulting model can smoothly change the properties of the output captions and show higher lexical alignment than baselines. For instance, CaptionSmiths reduces the error in controlling caption length by 506\\% despite better lexical alignment. Code will be available on https://github.com/omron-sinicx/captionsmiths.",

In this work, we examine scenarios where they can choose to collude, defined as secretive cooperation that harms another party. To systematically study this, we investigate the behavior of LLM agents acting as sellers in simulated continuous double auction markets. Through a series of controlled experiments, we analyze how parameters such as the ability to communicate, choice of model, and presence of environmental pressures affect the stability and emergence of seller collusion. We find that direct seller communication increases collusive tendencies, the propensity to collude varies across models, and environmental pressures, such as oversight and urgency from authority figures, influence collusive behavior.

      "abstract": "We introduce a new family of toy problems that combine features of linear-regression-style continuous in-context learning (ICL) with discrete associative recall. We pretrain transformer models on sample traces from this toy, specifically symbolically-labeled interleaved state observations from randomly drawn linear deterministic dynamical systems. We study if the transformer models can recall the state of a sequence previously seen in its context when prompted to do so with the corresponding in-context label. Taking a closer look at this task, it becomes clear that the model must perform two functions: (1) identify which system's state should be recalled and apply that system to its last seen state, and (2) continuing to apply the correct system to predict the subsequent states. Training dynamics reveal that the first capability emerges well into a model's training. Surprisingly, the second capability, of continuing the prediction of a resumed sequence, develops much earlier.\n  Via out-of-distribution experiments, and a mechanistic analysis on model weights via edge pruning, we find that next-token prediction for this toy problem involves at least two separate mechanisms. One mechanism uses the discrete symbolic labels to do the associative recall required to predict the start of a resumption of a previously seen sequence. The second mechanism, which is largely agnostic to the discrete symbolic labels, performs a \"Bayesian-style\" prediction based on the previous token and the context. These two mechanisms have different learning dynamics.\n  To confirm that this multi-mechanism (manifesting as separate phase transitions) phenomenon is not just an artifact of our toy setting, we used OLMo training checkpoints on an ICL translation task to see a similar phenomenon: a decisive gap in the emergence of first-task-token performance vs second-task-token performance.",

      "abstract": "Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical for safely deploying deep models in open-world environments, where inputs may lie outside the training distribution. During inference on a model trained exclusively with In-Distribution (ID) data, we observe a salient gradient phenomenon: around an ID sample, the local gradient directions for \"enhancing\" that sample's predicted class remain relatively consistent, whereas OOD samples--unseen in training--exhibit disorganized or conflicting gradient directions in the same neighborhood. Motivated by this observation, we propose an inference-stage technique to short-circuit those feature coordinates that spurious gradients exploit to inflate OOD confidence, while leaving ID classification largely intact. To circumvent the expense of recomputing the logits after this gradient short-circuit, we further introduce a local first-order approximation that accurately captures the post-modification outputs without a second forward pass. Experiments on standard OOD benchmarks show our approach yields substantial improvements. Moreover, the method is lightweight and requires minimal changes to the standard inference pipeline, offering a practical path toward robust OOD detection in real-world applications.",

      "abstract": "As AI integrates in various types of human writing, calls for transparency around AI assistance are growing. However, if transparency operates on uneven ground and certain identity groups bear a heavier cost for being honest, then the burden of openness becomes asymmetrical. This study investigates how AI disclosure statement affects perceptions of writing quality, and whether these effects vary by the author's race and gender. Through a large-scale controlled experiment, both human raters (n = 1,970) and LLM raters (n = 2,520) evaluated a single human-written news article while disclosure statements and author demographics were systematically varied. This approach reflects how both human and algorithmic decisions now influence access to opportunities (e.g., hiring, promotion) and social recognition (e.g., content recommendation algorithms). We find that both human and LLM raters consistently penalize disclosed AI use. However, only LLM raters exhibit demographic interaction effects: they favor articles attributed to women or Black authors when no disclosure is present. But these advantages disappear when AI assistance is revealed. These findings illuminate the complex relationships between AI disclosure and author identity, highlighting disparities between machine and human evaluation patterns.",

      "abstract": "Document shadow removal is a crucial task in the field of document image enhancement. However, existing methods tend to remove shadows with constant color background and ignore color shadows. In this paper, we first design a diffusion model in latent space for document image shadow removal, called DocShaDiffusion. It translates shadow images from pixel space to latent space, enabling the model to more easily capture essential features. To address the issue of color shadows, we design a shadow soft-mask generation module (SSGM). It is able to produce accurate shadow mask and add noise into shadow regions specially. Guided by the shadow mask, a shadow mask-aware guided diffusion module (SMGDM) is proposed to remove shadows from document images by supervising the diffusion and denoising process. We also propose a shadow-robust perceptual feature loss to preserve details and structures in document images. Moreover, we develop a large-scale synthetic document color shadow removal dataset (SDCSRD). It simulates the distribution of realistic color shadows and provides powerful supports for the training of models. Experiments on three public datasets validate the proposed method's superiority over state-of-the-art. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.",

The proposed S-box decomposes operations into subfields, leveraging a tower field architecture. This enables significant hardware reduction through optimized field inversion and a low-cost affine transformation. Security evaluations confirm resilience against linear, differential, algebraic and DPA attacks, validated via metrics including Nonlinearity (32512), Differential Uniformity (4), Algebraic Degree (15), Transparency order (15.9875) and SNR (0.34e-08). The hardware results, in 65 nm CMOS technology, show the proposed 16-bit S-box has lower hardware resources consumption and lower critical path delay (CPD) than those of other 16-bit S-boxes. By integrating high algebraic complexity with resource-efficient structures, this work addresses the growing demand for scalable cryptographic primitives in data-sensitive applications, demonstrating that larger S-boxes can enhance security without proportional hardware costs. The results underscore the viability of composite field-based architectures in balancing security and efficiency for modern block ciphers.",

      "abstract": "Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) for common-sense reasoning have led to the development of vision-language-action (VLA) models, enabling robots to perform generalized manipulation. Although existing autoregressive VLA methods design a specific architecture like dual-system to leverage large-scale pretrained knowledge, they tend to capture static information, often neglecting the dynamic aspects vital for embodied tasks. To this end, we propose TriVLA, a unified Vision-Language-Action model with a triple-system architecture for general robot control. The vision-language module (System 2) interprets the environment through vision and language instructions. The dynamics perception module (System 3) inherently produces visual representations that encompass both current static information and predicted future dynamics, thereby providing valuable guidance for policy learning. TriVLA utilizes pre-trained VLM model and fine-tunes pre-trained video foundation model on robot datasets along with internet human manipulation data. The subsequent policy learning module (System 1) generates fluid motor actions in real time. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that TriVLA operates at approximately 36 Hz and surpasses state-of-the-art imitation learning baselines on standard simulation benchmarks as well as challenging real-world manipulation tasks.",

We establish feasibility conditions that ensure tracking errors evolve within predefined funnel bounds while maintaining bounded control efforts, a crucial consideration for robots with limited actuation capabilities. We propose two approximation-free control strategies for scenarios where these conditions are violated: one actively corrects the error, and the other stops further deviation.

      "abstract": "Deepfakes pose significant security and privacy threats through malicious facial manipulations. While robust watermarking can aid in authenticity verification and source tracking, existing methods often lack the sufficient robustness against Deepfake manipulations. Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in image generation, enabling the seamless fusion of watermark with image during generation. In this study, we propose a novel robust watermarking framework based on diffusion model, called DiffMark. By modifying the training and sampling scheme, we take the facial image and watermark as conditions to guide the diffusion model to progressively denoise and generate corresponding watermarked image. In the construction of facial condition, we weight the facial image by a timestep-dependent factor that gradually reduces the guidance intensity with the decrease of noise, thus better adapting to the sampling process of diffusion model. To achieve the fusion of watermark condition, we introduce a cross information fusion (CIF) module that leverages a learnable embedding table to adaptively extract watermark features and integrates them with image features via cross-attention. To enhance the robustness of the watermark against Deepfake manipulations, we integrate a frozen autoencoder during training phase to simulate Deepfake manipulations. Additionally, we introduce Deepfake-resistant guidance that employs specific Deepfake model to adversarially guide the diffusion sampling process to generate more robust watermarked images. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DiffMark on typical Deepfakes. Our code will be available at https://github.com/vpsg-research/DiffMark.",

However, integrating in-memory arithmetic circuits with memory cells affects both the memory density and power efficiency. It remains challenging to build efficient in-memory arithmetic circuits on racetrack memory within area and energy constraints. To this end, we present an efficient in-memory convolutional neural network (CNN) accelerator optimized for use with racetrack memory. We design a series of fundamental arithmetic circuits as in-memory computing cells suited for multiply-and-accumulate operations. Moreover, we explore the design space of racetrack memory based systems and CNN model architectures, employing co-design to improve the efficiency and performance of performing CNN inference in racetrack memory while maintaining model accuracy. Our designed circuits and model-system co-optimization strategies achieve a small memory bank area with significant improvements in energy and performance for racetrack memory based embedded systems.",

The adaptation process assumes author familiarity with both the implementation of the example as well as how the new dataset might need to be transformed to fit into the example code. With recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), automatic adaptation of code can be achieved from high-level user prompts, reducing the barrier for visualization retargeting. To better understand how LLMs can assist retargeting and its potential limitations, we characterize and evaluate the performance of LLM assistance across multiple datasets and charts of varying complexity, categorizing failures according to type and severity. In our evaluation, we compare two approaches: (1) directly instructing the LLM model to fully generate and adapt code by treating code as text inputs and (2) a more constrained program synthesis pipeline where the LLM guides the code construction process by providing structural information (e.g., visual encodings) based on properties of the example code and data. We find that both approaches struggle when new data has not been appropriately transformed, and discuss important design recommendations for future retargeting systems.",

A deep learning method based on attention mechanisms is proposed to achieve unified modeling for information extraction and multi-label disease prediction. The study is conducted on the MIMIC-IV dataset. A Transformer-based architecture is used to perform representation learning over clinical text. Multi-layer self-attention mechanisms are employed to capture key medical entities and their contextual relationships. A Sigmoid-based multi-label classifier is then applied to predict multiple disease labels. The model incorporates a context-aware semantic alignment mechanism, enhancing its representational capacity in typical medical scenarios such as label co-occurrence and sparse information. To comprehensively evaluate model performance, a series of experiments were conducted, including baseline comparisons, hyperparameter sensitivity analysis, data perturbation studies, and noise injection tests. Results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms representative existing approaches across multiple performance metrics. The model maintains strong generalization under varying data scales, interference levels, and model depth configurations. The framework developed in this study offers an efficient algorithmic foundation for processing real-world clinical texts and presents practical significance for multi-label medical text modeling tasks.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention due to their versatility across a wide array of applications. Fine-tuning LLMs with parameter-efficient adapters, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enables these models to efficiently adapt to downstream tasks without extensive retraining. Deploying fine-tuned LLMs on multi-tenant edge devices offers substantial benefits, such as reduced latency, enhanced privacy, and personalized responses. However, serving LLMs efficiently on resource-constrained edge devices presents critical challenges, including the complexity of adapter selection for different tasks and memory overhead from frequent adapter swapping. Moreover, given the multiple requests in multi-tenant settings, processing requests sequentially results in underutilization of computational resources and increased latency. This paper introduces EdgeLoRA, an efficient system for serving LLMs on edge devices in multi-tenant environments. EdgeLoRA incorporates three key innovations: (1) an adaptive adapter selection mechanism to streamline the adapter configuration process; (2) heterogeneous memory management, leveraging intelligent adapter caching and pooling to mitigate memory operation overhead; and (3) batch LoRA inference, enabling efficient batch processing to significantly reduce computational latency. Comprehensive evaluations using the Llama3.1-8B model demonstrate that EdgeLoRA significantly outperforms the status quo (i.e., llama.cpp) in terms of both latency and throughput. The results demonstrate that EdgeLoRA can achieve up to a 4 times boost in throughput. Even more impressively, it can serve several orders of magnitude more adapters simultaneously. These results highlight EdgeLoRA's potential to transform edge deployment of LLMs in multi-tenant scenarios, offering a scalable and efficient solution for resource-constrained environments.",

      "abstract": "Robust estimation is essential in correspondence-based Point Cloud Registration (PCR). Existing methods using maximal clique search in compatibility graphs achieve high recall but suffer from exponential time complexity, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. To address this challenge, we propose a fast and robust estimator, TurboReg, built upon a novel lightweight clique, TurboClique, and a highly parallelizable Pivot-Guided Search (PGS) algorithm. First, we define the TurboClique as a 3-clique within a highly-constrained compatibility graph. The lightweight nature of the 3-clique allows for efficient parallel searching, and the highly-constrained compatibility graph ensures robust spatial consistency for stable transformation estimation. Next, PGS selects matching pairs with high SC$^2$ scores as pivots, effectively guiding the search toward TurboCliques with higher inlier ratios. Moreover, the PGS algorithm has linear time complexity and is significantly more efficient than the maximal clique search with exponential time complexity. Extensive experiments show that TurboReg achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world datasets, with substantial speed improvements. For example, on the 3DMatch+FCGF dataset, TurboReg (1K) operates $208.22\\times$ faster than 3DMAC while also achieving higher recall.

      "abstract": "Speculative decoding (SD), where a small draft model is employed to propose draft tokens in advance and then the target model validates them in parallel, has emerged as a promising technique for LLM inference acceleration. Many endeavors to improve SD are to eliminate the need for a draft model and generate draft tokens in a retrieval-based manner in order to further alleviate the drafting overhead and significantly reduce the difficulty in deployment and applications. However, retrieval-based SD relies on a matching paradigm to retrieval the most relevant reference as the draft tokens, where these methods often fail to find matched and accurate draft tokens. To address this challenge, we propose LogitSpec to effectively expand the retrieval range and find the most relevant reference as drafts. Our LogitSpec is motivated by the observation that the logit of the last token can not only predict the next token, but also speculate the next next token. Specifically, LogitSpec generates draft tokens in two steps: (1) utilizing the last logit to speculate the next next token; (2) retrieving relevant reference for both the next token and the next next token. LogitSpec is training-free and plug-and-play, which can be easily integrated into existing LLM inference frameworks. Extensive experiments on a wide range of text generation benchmarks demonstrate that LogitSpec can achieve up to 2.61 $\\times$ speedup and 3.28 mean accepted tokens per decoding step.

Two methods are proposed to construct the mesh: a deterministic method based on rotation mapping; a stochastic method utilizing autocorrelated random sequences. Core mechanisms ensuring the correctness of the method are analyzed, including the dual roles of mesh points as both integration points in the temporal domain and sampling points in the angular domain, the slow dynamics of the system excluding the fast angle variable, and the nearly commutative vector fields generated by applying different control inputs. The method is demonstrated through a multi-revolution low-thrust orbital rendezvous problem.

In our attack, a colluding group with sufficient voting power censors the remainder nodes such that the group alone can gain all the rewards from maintaining the blockchain. We show that if nodes are rational, coordinating this attack just requires a public read and write blackboard and we formally model the attack using a game theoretic framework. Furthermore, we note that to ensure the success of the attack, nodes need to know the total true voting power held by the colluding group. We prove that the strategy to join the rational censorship attack and also for nodes to honestly declare their power is a subgame perfect equilibrium in the corresponding extensive form game induced by our attack. Finally, we discuss the implications of the attack on blockchain users and protocol designers as well as some potential countermeasures.",

      "abstract": "Anomaly segmentation aims to identify Out-of-Distribution (OoD) anomalous objects within images. Existing pixel-wise methods typically assign anomaly scores individually and employ a global thresholding strategy to segment anomalies. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches encounter significant challenges in real-world applications: (1) neglecting spatial correlations among pixels within the same object, resulting in fragmented segmentation; (2) variabil ity in anomaly score distributions across image regions, causing global thresholds to either generate false positives in background areas or miss segments of anomalous objects. In this work, we introduce OoDDINO, a novel multi-level anomaly segmentation framework designed to address these limitations through a coarse-to-fine anomaly detection strategy. OoDDINO combines an uncertainty-guided anomaly detection model with a pixel-level segmentation model within a two-stage cascade architecture. Initially, we propose an Orthogonal Uncertainty-Aware Fusion Strategy (OUAFS) that sequentially integrates multiple uncertainty metrics with visual representations, employing orthogonal constraints to strengthen the detection model's capacity for localizing anomalous regions accurately. Subsequently, we develop an Adaptive Dual-Threshold Network (ADT-Net), which dynamically generates region-specific thresholds based on object-level detection outputs and pixel-wise anomaly scores. This approach allows for distinct thresholding strategies within foreground and background areas, achieving fine-grained anomaly segmentation. The proposed framework is compatible with other pixel-wise anomaly detection models, which acts as a plug-in to boost the performance. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets validate our framework's superiority and compatibility over state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "RISC-V provides a flexible and scalable platform for applications ranging from embedded devices to high-performance computing clusters. Particularly, its RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) becomes of interest for the acceleration of AI workloads. But writing software that efficiently utilizes the vector units of RISC-V CPUs without expert knowledge requires the programmer to rely on the autovectorization features of compilers or hand-crafted libraries like muRISCV-NN. Smarter approaches, like autotuning frameworks, have been missing the integration with the RISC-V RVV extension, thus heavily limiting the efficient deployment of complex AI workloads. In this paper, we present a workflow based on the TVM compiler to efficiently map AI workloads onto RISC-V vector units. Instead of relying on hand-crafted libraries, we integrated the RVV extension into TVM's MetaSchedule framework, a probabilistic program framework for tensor operation tuning. We implemented different RISC-V SoCs on an FPGA and tuned a wide range of AI workloads on them. We found that our proposal shows a mean improvement of 46% in execution latency when compared against the autovectorization feature of GCC, and 29% against muRISCV-NN. Moreover, the binary resulting from our proposal has a smaller code memory footprint, making it more suitable for embedded devices. Finally, we also evaluated our solution on a commercially available RISC-V SoC implementing the RVV 1.0 Vector Extension and found our solution is able to find mappings that are 35% faster on average than the ones proposed by LLVM. We open-sourced our proposal for the community to expand it to target other RISC-V extensions.",

As usual, it is not hard to remove the coloring by some extra graph gadgets, but at the cost of blowing up the size of the graphs and changing some parameters of them as well. This might lead to suboptimal combinatorial bounds important to their applications. Since then for some uncolored variants of the CFI-graphs it has been shown that they serve the same purposes. We show that this already applies to the graphs obtained from the original CFI-graphs by forgetting the colors.

Residual vibrations in these systems not only degrade operational efficiency but also pose risks to structural integrity and longevity. Traditional input shaping techniques, while effective, often suffer from performance degradation due to parameter inaccuracies and environmental disturbances. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an innovative unscented Kalman filter-based zero vibration derivative input shaping (UZS) method. The proposed approach combines two key innovations: 1) a data-driven Unscented Kalman Filterfor real-time system parameter identification, and 2) a zero-vibration derivative (ZVD) input shaper for robust vibration suppression. To validate the effectiveness of UZS, we conducted extensive experiments on a vertical flexible beam platform, and the results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we have made the experimental datasets publicly available to facilitate further research. The findings highlight UZS's potential for practical applications in industrial automation, robotics, and precision engineering.",

      "abstract": "Instance segmentation of novel objects instances in RGB images, given some example images for each object, is a well known problem in computer vision. Designing a model general enough to be employed, for all kinds of novel objects, without (re-) training, has proven to be a difficult task. To handle this, we propose a simple, yet powerful, framework, called: Novel Object Cyclic Threshold based Instance Segmentation (NOCTIS). This work stems from and improves upon previous ones like CNOS, SAM-6D and NIDS-Net; thus, it also leverages on recent vision foundation models, namely: Grounded-SAM 2 and DINOv2. It utilises Grounded-SAM 2 to obtain object proposals with precise bounding boxes and their corresponding segmentation masks; while DINOv2's zero-shot capabilities are employed to generate the image embeddings. The quality of those masks, together with their embeddings, is of vital importance to our approach; as the proposal-object matching is realized by determining an object matching score based on the similarity of the class embeddings and the average maximum similarity of the patch embeddings. Differently to SAM-6D, calculating the latter involves a prior patch filtering based on the distance between each patch and its corresponding cyclic/roundtrip patch in the image grid. Furthermore, the average confidence of the proposals' bounding box and mask is used as an additional weighting factor for the object matching score. We empirically show that NOCTIS, without further training/fine tuning, outperforms the best RGB and RGB-D methods on the seven core datasets of the BOP 2023 challenge for the \"Model-based 2D segmentation of unseen objects\" task.",

In this paper, we investigate how to design SK-type scheme for the quasi-static fading channel with I-CSIT and quantized feedback. By introducing modulo lattice function and an auxiliary signal into the SK-type encoder-decoder of the transceiver, we show that the decoding error caused by the I-CSIT can be perfectly eliminated, resulting in the success of designing SK-type scheme for such a case. The study of this paper provides a way to design efficient coding scheme for fading channels in the presence of imperfect CSI and quantized feedback.",

Current RPKI design heavily reuses legacy PKI components, such as X.509 EE-certificates, ASN.1 encoding, and XML-based repository protocols, all these introduce excessive cryptographic validation, redundant metadata, and inefficiencies in both storage and processing. We show that these design choices, although based on established standards, create significant performance bottlenecks, increase the vulnerability surface, and hinder scalability for wide-scale Internet deployment.\n  In this paper, we perform the first systematic analysis of the root causes of complexity in RPKI's design and experimentally quantify their real-world impact. We show that over 70% of validation time in RPKI relying parties is spent on certificate parsing and signature verification, much of it unnecessary. Building on this insight, we introduce the improved RPKI (iRPKI), a backwards-compatible redesign that preserves all security guarantees while substantially reducing protocol overhead. iRPKI eliminates EE-certificates and ROA signatures, merges revocation and integrity objects, replaces verbose encodings with Protobuf, and restructures repository metadata for more efficient access. We experimentally demonstrate that our implementation of iRPKI in the Routinator validator achieves a 20x speed-up of processing time, 18x improvement of bandwidth requirements and 8x reduction in cache memory footprint, while also eliminating classes of vulnerabilities that have led to at least 10 vulnerabilities in RPKI software. iRPKI significantly increases the feasibility of deploying RPKI at scale in the Internet, and especially in constrained environments. Our design may be deployed incrementally without impacting existing operations.",

      "abstract": "REPA and its variants effectively mitigate training challenges in diffusion models by incorporating external visual representations from pretrained models, through alignment between the noisy hidden projections of denoising networks and foundational clean image representations. We argue that the external alignment, which is absent during the entire denoising inference process, falls short of fully harnessing the potential of discriminative representations. In this work, we propose a straightforward method called Representation Entanglement for Generation (REG), which entangles low-level image latents with a single high-level class token from pretrained foundation models for denoising. REG acquires the capability to produce coherent image-class pairs directly from pure noise, substantially improving both generation quality and training efficiency. This is accomplished with negligible additional inference overhead, requiring only one single additional token for denoising (<0.5\\% increase in FLOPs and latency). The inference process concurrently reconstructs both image latents and their corresponding global semantics, where the acquired semantic knowledge actively guides and enhances the image generation process. On ImageNet 256$\\times$256, SiT-XL/2 + REG demonstrates remarkable convergence acceleration, achieving $\\textbf{63}\\times$ and $\\textbf{23}\\times$ faster training than SiT-XL/2 and SiT-XL/2 + REPA, respectively.

However, these institutions face several challenges in implementing IPSs, including environmental constraints, technical limits, and limited experimentation. In other contexts, Received Signal Strength (RSS)-based approaches using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and WiFi have emerged as preferred solutions due to their non-invasive nature and minimal infrastructure requirements. Nevertheless, the lack of publicly available RSS datasets that specifically reflect museum environments presents a substantial barrier to developing and evaluating positioning algorithms designed for the intricate spatial characteristics typical of cultural heritage sites. To address this limitation, we present BAR, a novel RSS dataset collected in front of 90 artworks across 13 museum rooms using two different platforms, i.e., Android and iOS.

      "abstract": "This work re-examines the commonly held assumption that the frequency of rewards is a reliable measure of task difficulty in reinforcement learning. We identify and formalize a structural challenge that undermines the effectiveness of current policy learning methods: when essential subgoals do not directly yield rewards. We characterize such settings as exhibiting zero-incentive dynamics, where transitions critical to success remain unrewarded. We show that state-of-the-art deep subgoal-based algorithms fail to leverage these dynamics and that learning performance is highly sensitive to the temporal proximity between subgoal completion and eventual reward. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation in current approaches and point to the need for mechanisms that can infer latent task structure without relying on immediate incentives.",

Multiple brain regions are associated with information processes and decision-making, and the connectivity of these regions may further influence inspectors' performance. However, researchers do not understand the pathways of the information flows when drone pilots process the maintenance and manipulation of information, which may affect the efficiency of tacit knowledge transfer. This study aims to reveal the causal connection between participants' brain regions using an electroencephalogram and dynamic causal modeling when processing drone-assisted building energy audit tasks using different display modalities. The results showed similar single-direction connectivity patterns for the different simulation groups. The results also showed similar patterns between brain regions related to visual inspection performance before and after training. These findings highlight the nature of brain asymmetries and may be utilized in measuring cognitive states and designing adaptive automation in the knowledge transfer of drone-based inspection.",

      "abstract": "Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and detecting its leaks early via hyperspectral satellite imagery can help mitigate climate change. Meanwhile, many existing missions operate in manual tasking regimes only, thus missing potential events of interest. To overcome slow downlink rates cost-effectively, onboard detection is a viable solution. However, traditional methane enhancement methods are too computationally demanding for resource-limited onboard hardware. This work accelerates methane detection by focusing on efficient, low-power algorithms. We test fast target detection methods (ACE, CEM) that have not been previously used for methane detection and propose a Mag1c-SAS - a significantly faster variant of the current state-of-the-art algorithm for methane detection: Mag1c. To explore their true detection potential, we integrate them with a machine learning model (U-Net, LinkNet). Our results identify two promising candidates (Mag1c-SAS and CEM), both acceptably accurate for the detection of strong plumes and computationally efficient enough for onboard deployment: one optimized more for accuracy, the other more for speed, achieving up to ~100x and ~230x faster computation than original Mag1c on resource-limited hardware. Additionally, we propose and evaluate three band selection strategies. One of them can outperform the method traditionally used in the field while using fewer channels, leading to even faster processing without compromising accuracy. This research lays the foundation for future advancements in onboard methane detection with minimal hardware requirements, improving timely data delivery. The produced code, data, and models are open-sourced and can be accessed from https://github.com/zaitra/methane-filters-benchmark.",

The lack of type information in dynamically-typed programming languages, such as Python, inhibits test generators, which heavily rely on information about parameter and return types of functions to select suitable arguments when constructing test cases. Since automated test generators inherently rely on frequent execution of candidate tests, we make use of these frequent executions to address this problem by introducing type tracing, which extracts type-related information during execution and gradually refines the available type information. We implement type tracing as an extension of the Pynguin test-generation framework for Python, allowing it (i) to infer parameter types by observing how parameters are used during runtime, (ii) to record the types of values that function calls return, and (iii) to use this type information to increase code coverage. The approach leads to up to 90.0% more branch coverage, improved mutation scores, and to type information of similar quality to that produced by other state-of-the-art type-inference tools.",

However, the pose tracking for industrial metal objects remains a challenging task especially in the real world-environments, due to the reflection characteristic of metal objects. To address this issue, we propose a novel 6DoF pose tracking method based on active control points. The method uses image control points to generate edge feature for optimization actively instead of 6DoF pose-based rendering, and serve them as optimization variables. We also introduce an optimal control point regression method to improve robustness. The proposed tracking method performs effectively in both dataset evaluation and real world tasks, providing a viable solution for real-time tracking of industrial metal objects.

Recent advancements in generative AI, especially large language models (LLMs), have substantially improved the quality of machine-generated text simplifications, thereby mitigating information barriers for the target group. However, existing LLM-based ATS systems do not incorporate preference feedback on text simplifications during training, resulting in a lack of personalization tailored to the specific needs of target group representatives.\n  In this work, we extend the standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approach for adapting LLM-based ATS models by leveraging a computationally efficient LLM alignment technique -- direct preference optimization (DPO). Specifically, we post-train LLM-based ATS models using human feedback collected from persons with intellectual disabilities, reflecting their preferences on paired text simplifications generated by mainstream LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a pipeline for developing personalized LLM-based ATS systems, encompassing data collection, model selection, SFT and DPO post-training, and evaluation. Our findings underscore the necessity of active participation of target group persons in designing personalized AI accessibility solutions aligned with human expectations. This work represents a step towards personalizing inclusive AI systems at the target-group level, incorporating insights not only from text simplification experts but also from target group persons themselves.",

While Camera-LiDAR fusion techniques have shown promising results by integrating data from both modalities, existing approaches primarily focus on improving model accuracy and often neglect the robustness of perception models, which is a critical aspect for real-world applications. In this paper, we explore strategies to enhance the robustness of multi-modal fusion methods for HD map construction while maintaining high accuracy. We propose three key components: data augmentation, a novel multi-modal fusion module, and a modality dropout training strategy. These components are evaluated on a challenging dataset containing 10 days of NuScenes data. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods significantly enhance the robustness of baseline methods. Furthermore, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the clean validation set of the NuScenes dataset. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing more robust and reliable HD map construction models, advancing their applicability in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.

BioMARS uses a hierarchical architecture: the Biologist Agent synthesizes protocols via retrieval-augmented generation; the Technician Agent translates them into executable robotic pseudo-code; and the Inspector Agent ensures procedural integrity through multimodal perception and anomaly detection. The system autonomously conducts cell passaging and culture tasks, matching or exceeding manual performance in viability, consistency, and morphological integrity. It also supports context-aware optimization, outperforming conventional strategies in differentiating retinal pigment epithelial cells. A web interface enables real-time human-AI collaboration, while a modular backend allows scalable integration with laboratory hardware.

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as one of the most significant technological advancements in artificial intelligence in recent years. Their ability to understand, generate, and reason with natural language has transformed how we interact with AI systems. With the development of LLM-based agents and reinforcement-learning-based reasoning models, the study of applying reinforcement learning in agent frameworks has become a new research focus. However, all previous studies face the challenge of deciding the tool calling process and the reasoning process simultaneously, and the chain of reasoning was solely relied on the unprocessed raw result with redundant information and symbols unrelated to the task from the tool, which impose a heavy burden on the model's capability to reason. Therefore, in our research, we proposed a hierarchical framework Agent-as-tool that detach the tool calling process and the reasoning process, which enables the model to focus on the verbally reasoning process while the tool calling process is handled by another agent. Our work had achieved comparable results with only a slight reinforcement fine-tuning on 180 samples, and had achieved exceptionally well performance in Bamboogle with 63.2% of exact match and 75.2% in cover exact match, exceeding Search-R1 by 4.8% in exact match and 3.2% in cover exact match.",

To address this limitation, we propose Aligned Video Captioning via Direct Preference Optimization (AVC-DPO), a post-training framework designed to enhance captioning capabilities in video MLLMs through preference alignment. Our approach designs enhanced prompts that specifically target temporal dynamics and spatial information-two key factors that humans care about when watching a video-thereby incorporating human-centric preferences. AVC-DPO leverages the same foundation model's caption generation responses under varied prompt conditions to conduct preference-aware training and caption alignment. Using this framework, we have achieved exceptional performance in the LOVE@CVPR'25 Workshop Track 1A: Video Detailed Captioning Challenge, achieving first place on the Video Detailed Captioning (VDC) benchmark according to the VDCSCORE evaluation metric.",

In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful solution, with techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers (ViTs), and hybrid models gaining popularity for automating pest detection. This review looks at 37 carefully selected studies published between 2018 and 2025, all focused on AI-based pest classification. The selected research is organized by crop type, pest species, model architecture, dataset usage, and key technical challenges. The early studies relied heavily on CNNs but latest work is shifting toward hybrid and transformer-based models that deliver higher accuracy and better contextual understanding. Still, challenges like imbalanced datasets, difficulty in detecting small pests, limited generalizability, and deployment on edge devices remain significant hurdles. Overall, this review offers a structured overview of the field, highlights useful datasets, and outlines the key challenges and future directions for AI-based pest monitoring systems.",

We propose a new real-image editing method for ReFlow by analyzing the intermediate representations of multimodal transformer blocks and identifying three key features. To extract these features from real images with sufficient structural preservation, we leverage mid-step latent, which is inverted only up to the mid-step. We then adapt attention during injection to improve editability and enhance alignment to the target text. Our method is training-free, requires no user-provided mask, and can be applied even without a source prompt. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks with nine baselines demonstrate its superior performance over prior methods, further validated by human evaluations confirming a strong user preference for our approach.",

One of the primary challenges in addressing these issues is the lack of monitoring forests to protect them. To tackle this problem, it is important to leverage remote sensing and computer vision methods to automate monitoring applications. Hence, automatic tree crown detection algorithms emerged based on traditional and deep learning methods. In this study, we first introduce two different tree crown detection methods based on these approaches. Then, we form a novel rule-based approach that integrates these two methods to enhance robustness and accuracy of tree crown detection results. While traditional methods are employed for feature extraction and segmentation of forested areas, deep learning methods are used to detect tree crowns in our method. With the proposed rule-based approach, we post-process these results, aiming to increase the number of detected tree crowns through neighboring trees and localized operations. We compare the obtained results with the proposed method in terms of the number of detected tree crowns and report the advantages, disadvantages, and areas for improvement of the obtained outcomes.",

However, this task remains a significant challenge due to the substantial variations in polyp shape, size, and color, as well as the high similarity between polyps and surrounding tissues, often compounded by indistinct boundaries. While existing encoder-decoder CNN and transformer-based approaches have shown promising results, they struggle with stable segmentation performance on polyps with weak or blurry boundaries. These methods exhibit limited abilities to distinguish between polyps and non-polyps and capture essential boundary cues. Moreover, their generalizability still falls short of meeting the demands of real-time clinical applications. To address these limitations, we propose SAM-MaGuP, a groundbreaking approach for robust polyp segmentation. By incorporating a boundary distillation module and a 1D-2D Mamba adapter within the Segment Anything Model (SAM), SAM-MaGuP excels at resolving weak boundary challenges and amplifies feature learning through enriched global contextual interactions. Extensive evaluations across five diverse datasets reveal that SAM-MaGuP outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving unmatched segmentation accuracy and robustness. Our key innovations, a Mamba-guided boundary prior and a 1D-2D Mamba block, set a new benchmark in the field, pushing the boundaries of polyp segmentation to new heights.",

      "abstract": "By incorporating visual inputs, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) extend LLMs to support visual reasoning. However, this integration also introduces new vulnerabilities, making MLLMs susceptible to multimodal jailbreak attacks and hindering their safe deployment.Existing defense methods, including Image-to-Text Translation, Safe Prompting, and Multimodal Safety Tuning, attempt to address this by aligning multimodal inputs with LLMs' built-in safeguards.Yet, they fall short in uncovering root causes of multimodal vulnerabilities, particularly how harmful multimodal tokens trigger jailbreak in MLLMs? Consequently, they remain vulnerable to text-driven multimodal jailbreaks, often exhibiting overdefensive behaviors and imposing heavy training overhead.To bridge this gap, we present an comprehensive analysis of where, how and which harmful multimodal tokens bypass safeguards in MLLMs. Surprisingly, we find that less than 1% tokens in early-middle layers are responsible for inducing unsafe behaviors, highlighting the potential of precisely removing a small subset of harmful tokens, without requiring safety tuning, can still effectively improve safety against jailbreaks. Motivated by this, we propose Safe Prune-then-Restore (SafePTR), an training-free defense framework that selectively prunes harmful tokens at vulnerable layers while restoring benign features at subsequent layers.Without incurring additional computational overhead, SafePTR significantly enhances the safety of MLLMs while preserving efficiency. Extensive evaluations across three MLLMs and five benchmarks demonstrate SafePTR's state-of-the-art performance in mitigating jailbreak risks without compromising utility.",

In this paper, we explore the different target objectives and corresponding loss functions in detail. We present a systematic overview of their relationships, unifying them under the framework of the variational lower bound objective. We complement this theoretical analysis with an empirical study providing insights into the conditions under which these objectives diverge in performance and the underlying factors contributing to such deviations. Additionally, we evaluate how the choice of objective impacts the model ability to achieve specific goals, such as generating high-quality samples or accurately estimating likelihoods. This study offers a unified understanding of loss functions in diffusion models, contributing to more efficient and goal-oriented model designs in future research.",

      "abstract": "This paper aims to comprehensively grasp the research status and development trends of soil microplastics (MPs). It collects studies from the Web of Science Core Collection covering the period from 2013 to 2024. Employing CiteSpace and VOSviewer, the paper conducts in - depth analyses of literature regarding the environmental impacts of microplastics. These analyses involve keyword co - occurrence, clustering, burst term identification, as well as co - occurrence analysis of authors and institutions. Microplastics can accumulate in soil, transfer through food chains, and ultimately affect human health, making the research on them essential for effective pollution control. Focusing on the international research on the impacts of microplastics on soil and ecosystems, the study reveals a steadily increasing trend in the number of publications each year, reaching a peak of 956 articles in 2024. A small number of highly productive authors contribute significantly to the overall research output. The keyword clustering analysis results in ten major clusters, including topics such as plastic pollution and microbial communities. The research on soil microplastics has evolved through three distinct stages: the preliminary exploration phase from 2013 to 2016, the expansion phase from 2017 to 2020, and the integration phase from 2021 to 2024. For future research, multi - level assessments of the impacts of microplastics on soil ecosystems and organisms should be emphasized, in order to fully uncover the associated hazards and develop practical solutions.",

For instance, many grid systems are heavily congested, highlighting the urgent need to enhance operational efficiency. However, reinforcement learning approaches have traditionally been slow due to the high sample complexity and expensive simulation requirements. While recent works have effectively used GPUs to accelerate data generation by converting environments to JAX, these works have largely focussed on classical toy problems. This paper introduces Chargax, a JAX-based environment for realistic simulation of electric vehicle charging stations designed for accelerated training of RL agents. We validate our environment in a variety of scenarios based on real data, comparing reinforcement learning agents against baselines. Chargax delivers substantial computational performance improvements of over 100x-1000x over existing environments. Additionally, Chargax' modular architecture enables the representation of diverse real-world charging station configurations.",

      "abstract": "Crossover is a powerful mechanism for generating new solutions from a given population of solutions. Crossover comes with a discrepancy in itself: on the one hand, crossover usually works best if there is enough diversity in the population; on the other hand, exploiting the benefits of crossover reduces diversity. This antagonism often makes crossover reduce its own effectiveness.\n  We introduce a new paradigm for utilizing crossover that reduces this antagonism, which we call diversity-preserving exploitation of crossover (DiPEC). The resulting Diversity Exploitation Genetic Algorithm (DEGA) is able to still exploit the benefits of crossover, but preserves a much higher diversity than conventional approaches.\n  We demonstrate the benefits by proving that the (2+1)-DEGA finds the optimum of LeadingOnes with $O(n^{5/3}\\log^{2/3} n)$ fitness evaluations. This is remarkable since standard genetic algorithms need $\\Theta(n^2)$ evaluations, and among genetic algorithms only some artificial and specifically tailored algorithms were known to break this runtime barrier. We confirm the theoretical results by simulations. Finally, we show that the approach is not overfitted to Leadingones by testing it empirically on other benchmarks and showing that it is also competitive in other settings. We believe that our findings justify further systematic investigations of the DiPEC paradigm.",

Through extensive ablation studies on YouTubeASL and How2Sign datasets, we analyze how different preprocessing strategies affect translation accuracy. Our results demonstrate that appropriate normalization, interpolation, and augmentation techniques can significantly improve model robustness and generalization abilities. Additionally, we provide a deep analysis of the model's attentions and reveal interesting behavior suggesting that adding a dedicated register token can improve overall model performance.

In a first step, a transport map is learned that normalizes the distribution to a noise distribution on the unit cube. This step is built on the statistical learning theory of neural ordinary differential equations, which has been established recently. Secondly, the composition of the generative map with the quantity of interest is integrated numerically using the Clenshaw-Curtis sparse grid quadrature. A decomposition of the total numerical error in quadrature error and statistical error is provided. As main result it is proven in the framework of empirical risk minimization that all error terms can be controlled in the sense of PAC (probably approximately correct) learning and with high probability the numerical integral approximates the theoretical value up to an arbitrary small error in the limit where the data set size is growing and the network capacity is increased adaptively.",

In this study, we explore the recently proposed State-Space Model, Mamba, leveraging its computational efficiency and capability for long-sequence modeling to effectively process dense image sequences in tracking tasks. First, we highlight the issue of temporal inconsistency in existing Mamba-based methods, specifically the failure to account for temporal continuity in the Mamba scanning mechanism. Secondly, building upon this insight,we propose TrackingMiM, a Mamba-in-Mamba architecture, a minimal-computation burden model for handling image sequence of tracking problem. In our framework, the mamba scan is performed in a nested way while independently process temporal and spatial coherent patch tokens. While the template frame is encoded as query token and utilized for tracking in every scan. Extensive experiments conducted on five UAV tracking benchmarks confirm that the proposed TrackingMiM achieves state-of-the-art precision while offering noticeable higher speed in UAV tracking.",

AI harmonization techniques can address this problem by reducing distribution shifts caused by various acquisition settings. This paper presents an open-source benchmark dataset containing CT scans of an anthropomorphic phantom acquired with various scanners and settings, which purpose is to foster the development of AI harmonization techniques. Using a phantom allows fixing variations attributed to inter- and intra-patient variations. The dataset includes 1378 image series acquired with 13 scanners from 4 manufacturers across 8 institutions using a harmonized protocol as well as several acquisition doses.

The second step then leverages an emerging LLM-based approach, where a fine-tuned LLM is triggered to make a final decision on instances with high uncertainty. Unlike prior approaches, our method effectively balances computational efficiency and performance, combining traditional approaches with LLMs and yielding state-of-the-art results on key OOS detection benchmarks, including real-world OOS data acquired from a deployed TODS.",

      "abstract": "In the stance detection task, a text is classified as either favorable, opposing, or neutral towards a target. Prior work suggests that the use of external information, e.g., excerpts from Wikipedia, improves stance detection performance. However, whether or not such information can benefit large language models (LLMs) remains an unanswered question, despite their wide adoption in many reasoning tasks. In this study, we conduct a systematic evaluation on how Wikipedia and web search external information can affect stance detection across eight LLMs and in three datasets with 12 targets. Surprisingly, we find that such information degrades performance in most cases, with macro F1 scores dropping by up to 27.9\\%. We explain this through experiments showing LLMs' tendency to align their predictions with the stance and sentiment of the provided information rather than the ground truth stance of the given text. We also find that performance degradation persists with chain-of-thought prompting, while fine-tuning mitigates but does not fully eliminate it. Our findings, in contrast to previous literature on BERT-based systems which suggests that external information enhances performance, highlight the risks of information biases in LLM-based stance classifiers.

      "abstract": "Scientific applications of machine learning often rely on small, specialized models tuned to particular domains. Such models often achieve excellent performance, but lack flexibility. Foundation models offer versatility, but typically underperform specialized approaches, especially on non-traditional modalities and long-tail domains. We propose MARVIS (Modality Adaptive Reasoning over VISualizations), a training-free method that enables even small vision-language models to predict any data modality with high accuracy. MARVIS transforms latent embedding spaces into visual representations and then leverages the spatial and fine-grained reasoning skills of VLMs to successfully interpret and utilize them. MARVIS achieves competitive performance on vision, audio, biological, and tabular domains using a single 3B parameter model, achieving results that beat Gemini by 16\\% on average and approach specialized methods, without exposing personally identifiable information (P.I.I.) or requiring any domain-specific training.

However, ageing assets, climate change impacts (e.g., extreme weather, rising sea levels), and hybrid threats ranging from natural disasters to cyber attacks and conflicts pose growing risks to their resilience and functionality. This review paper explores how emerging digital technologies, specifically Artificial Intelligence (AI), can enhance damage assessment and monitoring of transport infrastructure. A systematic literature review examines existing AI models and datasets for assessing damage in roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure impacted by natural disasters. Special focus is given to the unique challenges and opportunities associated with bridge damage detection due to their structural complexity and critical role in connectivity. The integration of SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data with AI models is also discussed, with the review revealing a critical research gap: a scarcity of studies applying AI models to SAR data for comprehensive bridge damage assessment. Therefore, this review aims to identify the research gaps and provide foundations for AI-driven solutions for assessing and monitoring critical transport infrastructures.",

To achieve a singularity-free orientation parametrization of the rod, the nodal kinematical unknowns are defined as the nodal centerline positions and unit quaternions. We apply Lagrangian interpolation to all nodal kinematic coordinates, and in combination with a projection of non-unit quaternions, this leads to an interpolation with orthonormal cross-section-fixed bases. To eliminate locking effects such as shear locking, the variational Hellinger--Reissner principle is applied, resulting in a mixed approach with additional fields composed of resultant contact forces and moments. Since the mixed formulation contains the constitutive law in compliance form, it naturally incorporates constrained theories, such as the Kirchhoff--Love theory. This study specifically examines the influence of the additional internal force fields on the numerical performance, including locking mitigation and robustness. Using well-established benchmark examples, the method demonstrates enhanced computational robustness and efficiency, as evidenced by the reduction in required load steps and iterations when applying the standard Newton--Raphson method.",

Although empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, the underlying mechanisms that drive these improvements remain unclear. In this work, we investigate in detail the pattern of learning and forgetting that take place inside a convolutional neural network when trained in challenging settings such as continual learning and few-shot transfer learning, with handwritten characters and natural images. Our experiments show that models that have undergone zapping during training more quickly recover from the shock of transferring to a new domain. Furthermore, to better observe the effect of continual learning in a multi-task setting we measure how each individual task is affected. This shows that, not only zapping, but the choice of optimizer can also deeply affect the dynamics of learning and forgetting, causing complex patterns of synergy/interference between tasks to emerge when the model learns sequentially at transfer time.",

The proposed approach is based on E2PANNs, a fine-tuned convolutional neural network derived from EPANNs, and optimized for binary sound event detection under urban acoustic conditions. A key contribution is the creation of curated and semantically structured datasets - AudioSet-EV, AudioSet-EV Augmented, and Unified-EV - developed using a custom AudioSet-Tools framework to overcome the low reliability of standard AudioSet annotations. The system is deployed on a Raspberry Pi 5 equipped with a high-fidelity DAC+microphone board, implementing a multithreaded inference engine with adaptive frame sizing, probability smoothing, and a decision-state machine to control false positive activations. A remote WebSocket interface provides real-time monitoring and facilitates live demonstration capabilities. Performance is evaluated using both framewise and event-based metrics across multiple configurations. Results show the system achieves low-latency detection with improved robustness under realistic audio conditions. This work demonstrates the feasibility of deploying IoS-compatible SED solutions that can form distributed acoustic monitoring networks, enabling collaborative emergency vehicle tracking across smart city infrastructures through WebSocket connectivity on low-cost edge devices.",

      "abstract": "Time-varying coverage control addresses the challenge of coordinating multiple agents covering an environment where regions of interest change over time. This problem has broad applications, including the deployment of autonomous taxis and coordination in search and rescue operations. The achievement of effective coverage is complicated by the presence of time-varying density functions, nonlinear agent dynamics, and stringent system and safety constraints. In this paper, we present a distributed multi-agent control framework for time-varying coverage under nonlinear constrained dynamics. Our approach integrates a reference trajectory planner and a tracking model predictive control (MPC) scheme, which operate at different frequencies within a multi-rate framework. For periodic density functions, we demonstrate closed-loop convergence to an optimal configuration of trajectories and provide formal guarantees regarding constraint satisfaction, collision avoidance, and recursive feasibility. Additionally, we propose an efficient algorithm capable of handling nonperiodic density functions, making the approach suitable for practical applications. Finally, we validate our method through hardware experiments using a fleet of four miniature race cars.",

However, automated methods must be robust in the presence of imbalanced input data, which can negatively affect performance. Additionally, automated methods should make explainable decisions. In this work, we evaluate the effect of label imbalance on the classification of network intrusion alerts. As our use-case we employ DeepCASE, the state-of-the-art method for automated alert classification. We show that label imbalance impacts both classification performance and correctness of the classification explanations offered by DeepCASE. We conclude tuning the detection rules used in SOCs can significantly reduce imbalance and may benefit the performance and explainability offered by alert post-processing methods such as DeepCASE. Therefore, our findings suggest that traditional methods to improve the quality of input data can benefit automation.",

      "abstract": "Remote sensing semantic segmentation must address both what the ground objects are within an image and where they are located. Consequently, segmentation models must ensure not only the semantic correctness of large-scale patches (low-frequency information) but also the precise localization of boundaries between patches (high-frequency information). However, most existing approaches rely heavily on discriminative learning, which excels at capturing low-frequency features, while overlooking its inherent limitations in learning high-frequency features for semantic segmentation. Recent studies have revealed that diffusion generative models excel at generating high-frequency details. Our theoretical analysis confirms that the diffusion denoising process significantly enhances the model's ability to learn high-frequency features; however, we also observe that these models exhibit insufficient semantic inference for low-frequency features when guided solely by the original image. Therefore, we integrate the strengths of both discriminative and generative learning, proposing the Integration of Discriminative and diffusion-based Generative learning for Boundary Refinement (IDGBR) framework. The framework first generates a coarse segmentation map using a discriminative backbone model. This map and the original image are fed into a conditioning guidance network to jointly learn a guidance representation subsequently leveraged by an iterative denoising diffusion process refining the coarse segmentation. Extensive experiments across five remote sensing semantic segmentation datasets (binary and multi-class segmentation) confirm our framework's capability of consistent boundary refinement for coarse results from diverse discriminative architectures.

To meet these challenges, we propose a vision-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework for UAV-assisted access systems, where onboard masked De-Diffusion models extract compact semantic tokens, including agent type, activity class, and heading orientation, while explicitly suppressing sensitive visual content. These tokens are fused with mmWave radar measurements to construct a semantic risk heatmap reflecting motion density, occlusion, and scene complexity, which guides access technology selection and resource scheduling. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to jointly maximize weighted energy and perception efficiency via radio access technology (RAT) assignment, power control, and beamforming, subject to agent-specific QoS constraints. To solve this, we develop De-Diffusion-driven vision-aided risk-aware resource optimization algorithm DeDiff-VARARO, a novel two-stage cross-modal control algorithm: the first stage reconstructs visual scenes from tokens via De-Diffusion model for semantic parsing, while the second stage employs a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based policy to adapt RAT selection, power control, and beam assignment based on fused radar-visual states. Simulation results show that DeDiff-VARARO consistently outperforms baselines in reward convergence, link robustness, and semantic fidelity, achieving within $4\\%$ of the performance of a raw-image upper bound while preserving user privacy and scalability in dense environments.",

We discuss two possibilities to obtain a ground interpolant from a proof, with clausal tableaux, and with resolution. Established preprocessing techniques for first-order proving can also be applied for Craig interpolation if they are restricted in specific ways. Equality encodings from automated reasoning justify strengthened variations of Craig interpolation. Also further contributions to Craig interpolation emerged from automated reasoning.

Traditional indoor localization techniques often produce significant errors and raise privacy concerns due to centralized data collection. In response, Machine Learning (ML) techniques offer promising solutions by capturing indoor environment variations.

To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Federated Learning (FL)-based approach for dynamic indoor localization using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. Experimental results show that FL has the nearby performance to Centralized Model (CL) while keeping the data privacy, bandwidth efficiency and server reliability. This research demonstrates that our proposed FL approach provides a viable solution for privacy-enhanced indoor localization, paving the way for advancements in secure and efficient indoor localization systems.",

This paper addresses the challenge of generating classical piano performances from scratch, aiming to emulate the dual roles of composer and pianist in the creative process. We introduce the Expressive Compound Word (ECP) representation, which effectively captures both the metrical structure and expressive nuances of classical performances. Building on this, we propose the Expressive Music Variational AutoEncoder (XMVAE), a model featuring two branches: a Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) branch that generates score-related content, representing the Composer, and a vanilla VAE branch that produces expressive details, fulfilling the role of Pianist. These branches are jointly trained with similar Seq2Seq architectures, leveraging a multiscale encoder to capture beat-level contextual information and an orthogonal Transformer decoder for efficient compound tokens decoding. Both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that XMVAE generates classical performances with superior musical quality compared to state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, pretraining the Composer branch on extra musical score datasets contribute to a significant performance gain.",

      "abstract": "Recent deep learning-based image denoising methods have shown impressive performance; however, many lack the flexibility to adjust the denoising strength based on the noise levels, camera settings, and user preferences. In this paper, we introduce a new controllable denoising framework that adaptively removes noise from images by utilizing information from camera parameters. Specifically, we focus on ISO, shutter speed, and F-number, which are closely related to noise levels. We convert these selected parameters into a vector to control and enhance the performance of the denoising network. Experimental results show that our method seamlessly adds controllability to standard denoising neural networks and improves their performance.

The extensive evaluation of the system shows promising results. Sleep detection achieves 97. 42% mAP@50, face recognition achieves 86. 45% validation accuracy and mobile phone detection reach 85. 89% mAP@50. The system is implemented within a core PHP web application and utilizes ESP32-CAM hardware for seamless data capture.(Neto et al., 2024) This integrated approach not only enhances classroom monitoring, but also ensures automatic attendance recording via face recognition as students remain seated in the classroom, offering scalability for diverse educational environments.(Banada,2025)",

While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved linguistic fluency and contextual understanding, building effective and emotionally intelligent ToD systems remains a complex challenge.

In this work, we investigate architectural, representational, optimisational as well as emotional considerations of ToD systems.

Most research on TKG reasoning (TKGR) focuses on modelling the repetition of global facts and designing patterns of local historical facts. However, they face two significant challenges: inadequate modeling of the event distribution shift between training and test samples, and reliance on random entity substitution for generating negative samples, which often results in low-quality sampling. To this end, we propose a novel distributional feature modeling approach for training TKGR models, Test-Time Training-guided Distribution shift Modelling (T3DM), to adjust the model based on distribution shift and ensure the global consistency of model reasoning. In addition, we design a negative-sampling strategy to generate higher-quality negative quadruples based on adversarial training. Extensive experiments show that T3DM provides better and more robust results than the state-of-the-art baselines in most cases.",

For instance, while there are numerous data science tools available, developing a pipeline planning system to coordinate these tools remains challenging. This difficulty arises because existing Data+AI systems have limited capabilities in semantic understanding, reasoning, and planning. Fortunately, we have witnessed the success of large language models (LLMs) in enhancing semantic understanding, reasoning, and planning abilities. It is crucial to incorporate LLM techniques to revolutionize data systems for orchestrating Data+AI applications effectively.\n  To achieve this, we propose the concept of a 'Data Agent' - a comprehensive architecture designed to orchestrate Data+AI ecosystems, which focuses on tackling data-related tasks by integrating knowledge comprehension, reasoning, and planning capabilities. We delve into the challenges involved in designing data agents, such as understanding data/queries/environments/tools, orchestrating pipelines/workflows, optimizing and executing pipelines, and fostering pipeline self-reflection. Furthermore, we present examples of data agent systems, including a data science agent, data analytics agents (such as unstructured data analytics agent, semantic structured data analytics agent, data lake analytics agent, and multi-modal data analytics agent), and a database administrator (DBA) agent. We also outline several open challenges associated with designing data agent systems.",

Existing methods typically split videos into overlapping sliding windows, leading to accumulated scale discrepancies across different windows, particularly as the number of windows increases. Additionally, these methods rely solely on 2D diffusion priors, overlooking the inherent 3D geometric structure of video depths, which results in geometrically inconsistent predictions. In this paper, we propose DepthSync, a novel, training-free framework using diffusion guidance to achieve scale- and geometry-consistent depth predictions for long videos. Specifically, we introduce scale guidance to synchronize the depth scale across windows and geometry guidance to enforce geometric alignment within windows based on the inherent 3D constraints in video depths. These two terms work synergistically, steering the denoising process toward consistent depth predictions. Experiments on various datasets validate the effectiveness of our method in producing depth estimates with improved scale and geometry consistency, particularly for long videos.",

This paper conducts the first system-level study of backdoors in deep learning-based face recognition systems. This paper yields four contributions by exploring the feasibility of DNN backdoors on these pipelines in a holistic fashion. We demonstrate for the first time two backdoor attacks on the face detection task: face generation and face landmark shift attacks. We then show that face feature extractors trained with large margin losses also fall victim to backdoor attacks. Combining our models, we then show using 20 possible pipeline configurations and 15 attack cases that a single backdoor enables an attacker to bypass the entire function of a system. Finally, we provide stakeholders with several best practices and countermeasures.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, compressed domain semantic inference has primarily relied on learned image coding models optimized for mean squared error (MSE). However, MSE-oriented optimization tends to yield latent spaces with limited semantic richness, which hinders effective semantic inference in downstream tasks. Moreover, achieving high performance with these models often requires fine-tuning the entire vision model, which is computationally intensive, especially for large models. To address these problems, we introduce Perception-Oriented Latent Coding (POLC), an approach that enriches the semantic content of latent features for high-performance compressed domain semantic inference. With the semantically rich latent space, POLC requires only a plug-and-play adapter for fine-tuning, significantly reducing the parameter count compared to previous MSE-oriented methods. Experimental results demonstrate that POLC achieves rate-perception performance comparable to state-of-the-art generative image coding methods while markedly enhancing performance in vision tasks, with minimal fine-tuning overhead.

      "abstract": "Group recommendation over social media streams has attracted significant attention due to its wide applications in domains such as e-commerce, entertainment, and online news broadcasting. By leveraging social connections and group behaviours, group recommendation (GR) aims to provide more accurate and engaging content to a set of users rather than individuals. Recently, influence-aware GR has emerged as a promising direction, as it considers the impact of social influence on group decision-making. In earlier work, we proposed Influence-aware Group Recommendation (IGR) to solve this task. However, this task remains challenging due to three key factors: the large and ever-growing scale of social graphs, the inherently dynamic nature of influence propagation within user groups, and the high computational overhead of real-time group-item matching.\n  To tackle these issues, we propose an Enhanced Influence-aware Group Recommendation (EIGR) framework. First, we introduce a Graph Extraction-based Sampling (GES) strategy to minimise redundancy across multiple temporal social graphs and effectively capture the evolving dynamics of both groups and items. Second, we design a novel DYnamic Independent Cascade (DYIC) model to predict how influence propagates over time across social items and user groups. Finally, we develop a two-level hash-based User Group Index (UG-Index) to efficiently organise user groups and enable real-time recommendation generation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework, EIGR, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both effectiveness and efficiency.",

Using this high resolution data, we generate spatially distributed contact angle maps that reveal previously hidden wettability heterogeneity. Our analysis of mixed-wet systems demonstrates the severe limitations of averaged metrics: a sample with a mean contact angle of 64.7 degrees, conventionally classified as uniformly weakly water-wet, exhibits 40% of its pore space in the intermediate-wetting regime (70-110 degrees). This heterogeneity explains the presence of minimal surface interfaces and fundamentally different pore-filling mechanisms operating within the same sample. By providing open-source tools for spatially-resolved wettability characterization, this work enables more accurate predictions of multiphase flow behavior in heterogeneous porous materials, essential for optimizing subsurface energy storage and recovery processes.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) systems have been widely adopted in many areas, and are becoming even more popular with the emergence of large language models. However, due to the complex software stacks involved in their development and execution, crashes are unavoidable and common. Crashes severely waste computing resources and hinder development productivity, so efficient crash recovery is crucial. Existing solutions, such as checkpoint-retry, are too heavyweight for fast recovery from crashes caused by minor programming errors or transient runtime errors. Therefore, we present DaiFu, an in-situ recovery framework for DL systems. Through a lightweight code transformation to a given DL system, DaiFu augments it to intercept crashes in situ and enables dynamic and instant updates to its program running context (e.g., code, configurations, and other data) for agile crash recovery. Our evaluation shows that DaiFu helps reduce the restore time for crash recovery, achieving a 1372x speedup compared with state-of-the-art solutions. Meanwhile, the overhead of DaiFu is negligible (under 0.40%). We also construct a benchmark spanning 7 distinct crash scenarios in DL systems, and show the effectiveness of DaiFu in diverse situations.",

This paper introduces an empirical approach to estimating the required number of runs per problem instance for accurate estimation of the performance of the continuous single-objective stochastic optimization algorithm. The method leverages probability theory, incorporating a robustness check to identify significant imbalances in the data distribution relative to the mean, and dynamically adjusts the number of runs during execution as an online approach. The proposed methodology was extensively tested across two algorithm portfolios (104 Differential Evolution configurations and the Nevergrad portfolio) and the COCO benchmark suite, totaling 5748000 runs. The results demonstrate 82% - 95% accuracy in estimations across different algorithms, allowing a reduction of approximately 50% in the number of runs without compromising optimization outcomes. This online calculation of required runs not only improves benchmarking efficiency, but also contributes to energy reduction, fostering a more environmentally sustainable computing ecosystem.",

      "abstract": "The task of Human-Object conTact (HOT) detection involves identifying the specific areas of the human body that are touching objects. Nevertheless, current models are restricted to just one type of image, often leading to too much segmentation in areas with little interaction, and struggling to maintain category consistency within specific regions. To tackle this issue, a HOT framework, termed \\textbf{P3HOT}, is proposed, which blends \\textbf{P}rompt guidance and human \\textbf{P}roximal \\textbf{P}erception. To begin with, we utilize a semantic-driven prompt mechanism to direct the network's attention towards the relevant regions based on the correlation between image and text. Then a human proximal perception mechanism is employed to dynamically perceive key depth range around the human, using learnable parameters to effectively eliminate regions where interactions are not expected. Calculating depth resolves the uncertainty of the overlap between humans and objects in a 2D perspective, providing a quasi-3D viewpoint. Moreover, a Regional Joint Loss (RJLoss) has been created as a new loss to inhibit abnormal categories in the same area. A new evaluation metric called ``AD-Acc.'' is introduced to address the shortcomings of existing methods in addressing negative samples. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in four metrics across two benchmark datasets. Specifically, our model achieves an improvement of \\textbf{0.7}$\\uparrow$, \\textbf{2.0}$\\uparrow$, \\textbf{1.6}$\\uparrow$, and \\textbf{11.0}$\\uparrow$ in SC-Acc., mIoU, wIoU, and AD-Acc. metrics, respectively, on the HOT-Annotated dataset.

However, state-of-the-art NeRF methods are typically constrained to small scenes due to the memory footprint during training, which we study in this paper. Previous work on large-scale NeRFs palliate this by dividing the scene into NeRFs. This paper introduces Snake-NeRF, a framework that scales to large scenes. Our out-of-core method eliminates the need to load all images and networks simultaneously, and operates on a single device. We achieve this by dividing the region of interest into NeRFs that 3D tile without overlap. Importantly, we crop the images with overlap to ensure each NeRFs is trained with all the necessary pixels. We introduce a novel $2\\times 2$ 3D tile progression strategy and segmented sampler, which together prevent 3D reconstruction errors along the tile edges. Our experiments conclude that large satellite images can effectively be processed with linear time complexity, on a single GPU, and without compromise in quality.",

This paper empirically investigates the strengths and weaknesses of both global scores and pairwise comparisons to aid decision-making in selecting appropriate model evaluation strategies. Through computational experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets using standard global metrics and the popular Bradley-Terry model for pairwise comparisons, we found that while global scores provide more reliable overall rankings, they can underestimate strong models with rare, significant errors or low confidence. Conversely, pairwise comparisons are particularly effective for identifying strong contenders among models with lower global scores, especially where quality metrics are hard to define (e.g., text generation), though they require more comparisons to converge if ties are frequent.

To overcome the challenges of data scarcity and the inability of generating high-quality pseudo-labels from corrupted images, we propose an unsupervised consistency regularization finetuning paradigm that requires only a relatively small amount of unlabeled data. Furthermore, we propose the Spatial Distance Constraint to explicitly enforce the model to learn patch-level relative relationships, resulting in clearer semantic boundaries and more accurate details.

Our study is the first work that uncovers widespread public key reuse across Ethereum's peer-to-peer networks - a practice that fundamentally undermines the protocol's privacy guarantees. Through systematic analysis of 300 real-world network snapshots, we identify 83 users controlling 483 service nodes via public key reuse, enabling precise de-anonymization through IP correlation. Using evidence collected by EGNInfoLeaker, our Graph-Based Identity Association Algorithm links users to network entities and generates comprehensive user profiles. For User27, it exposes the public key, IP, network ID, location (country/region/city), and ISP/ORG details. The EGNInfoLeaker system demonstrates how such cryptographic misuse transforms theoretical anonymity into practical identity leakage, exposing users to surveillance and targeted attacks. These findings establish that protocol security depends not only on sound design but also on strict user compliance. Going forward, our detection framework provides a foundation for enhancing real-world privacy preservation in decentralized networks.",

In this framework, input signals are nonlinearly mapped to a high-dimensional feature space and represented sparsely using a virtual dictionary. At each step, the dictionary is updated recursively using a novel algorithm based on the recursive least squares (RLS) method. This update mechanism works with single samples or mini-batches and maintains low computational complexity.

Joint spatial division and multiplexing (JSDM) emerges as a low-overhead transmission scheme for multi-user equipment (UE) scenarios, typically requiring complex matrix decomposition to achieve block-diagonalization of the effective channel matrix. In this study, we introduce an innovative JSDM design that leverages RISs to customize channels, thereby streamlining the overall procedures. By strategically positioning RISs at the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) directions of the base station (BS), we establish orthogonal line-of-sight links within the BS-RIS channel, enabling a straightforward pre-beamforming design. Based on UE grouping, we devise reflected beams of the RIS with optimized directions to mitigate inter-group interference in the RISs-UEs channel. An approximation of the channel cross-correlation coefficient is derived and serves as a foundation for the RISs-UEs association, further diminishing inter-group interference. Numerical results substantiate the efficacy of our RIS-customized JSDM in not only achieving effective channel block-diagonalization but also in significantly enhancing the sum spectral efficiency for multi-UE transmissions.",

Although most ViTs achieve impressive performance through image-text pair-based contrastive learning or self-supervised mechanisms, they struggle to engage in connector-based co-training directly with LLMs due to potential parameter initialization conflicts and modality semantic gaps. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes SAILViT, a gradual feature learning-enhanced ViT for facilitating MLLMs to break through performance bottlenecks in complex multimodal interactions. SAILViT achieves coarse-to-fine-grained feature alignment and world knowledge infusion with gradual feature refinement, which better serves target training demands. We perform thorough empirical analyses to confirm the powerful robustness and generalizability of SAILViT across different dimensions, including parameter sizes, model architectures, training strategies, and data scales. Equipped with SAILViT, existing MLLMs show significant and consistent performance improvements on the OpenCompass benchmark across extensive downstream tasks.

We evaluate both zero-shot performance and adapter-based transfer on ten local languages using models of different types: a monolingual Indonesian BERT, multilingual models such as mBERT and XLM-R, and a modular adapter-based approach called MAD-X. To better understand model behavior, we group the target languages into three categories: seen (included during pre-training), partially seen (not included but linguistically related to seen languages), and unseen (absent and unrelated in pre-training data). Our results reveal clear performance disparities across these groups: multilingual models perform best on seen languages, moderately on partially seen ones, and poorly on unseen languages. We find that MAD-X significantly improves performance, especially for seen and partially seen languages, without requiring labeled data in the target language. Additionally, we conduct a further analysis on tokenization and show that while subword fragmentation and vocabulary overlap with Indonesian correlate weakly with prediction quality, they do not fully explain the observed performance. Instead, the most consistent predictor of transfer success is the model's prior exposure to the language, either directly or through a related language.",

Therefore, practitioners often treat gradients as inputs to task-specific algorithms, e.g. for pruning or optimization. Recent works explore learning algorithms that operate directly on gradients but use architectures that are not specifically designed for gradient processing, limiting their applicability. In this paper, we present a principled approach for designing architectures that process gradients. Our approach is guided by three principles: (1) equivariant design that preserves neuron permutation symmetries, (2) processing sets of gradients across multiple data points to capture curvature information, and (3) efficient gradient representation through rank-1 decomposition. Based on these principles, we introduce GradMetaNet, a novel architecture for learning on gradients, constructed from simple equivariant blocks. We prove universality results for GradMetaNet, and show that previous approaches cannot approximate natural gradient-based functions that GradMetaNet can. We then demonstrate GradMetaNet's effectiveness on a diverse set of gradient-based tasks on MLPs and transformers, such as learned optimization, INR editing, and estimating loss landscape curvature.",

In this paper, we bring some empirical evidences that, on the contrary, AI and neuroscience are continuing to grow together, but with a pronounced interest in the fields of study related to neurodegenerative diseases since the 1990s. With a temporal knowledge cartography of neuroscience drawn with advanced document embedding techniques, we draw the dynamical shaping of the discipline since the 1970s and identified the conceptual articulation of AI with this particular subfield mentioned before. However, a further analysis of the underlying citation network of the studied corpus shows that the produced AI technologies remain confined in the different subfields and are not transferred from one subfield to another. This invites us to discuss the genericity capability of AI in the context of an intradisciplinary development, especially in the diffusion of its associated metrology.",

However, prevalent AR models predominantly rely on the transformer architectures, which are beset by quadratic computational complexity concerning input sequence length and substantial memory overhead due to the necessity of maintaining key-value caches. Although linear attention mechanisms have successfully reduced this burden in language models, our initial experiments reveal that they significantly degrade image generation quality because of their inability to capture critical long-range dependencies in visual data. We propose Linear Attention with Spatial-Aware Decay (LASAD), a novel attention mechanism that explicitly preserves genuine 2D spatial relationships within the flattened image sequences by computing position-dependent decay factors based on true 2D spatial location rather than 1D sequence positions. Based on this mechanism, we present LASADGen, an autoregressive image generator that enables selective attention to relevant spatial contexts with linear complexity. Experiments on ImageNet show LASADGen achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance and computational efficiency, bridging the gap between linear attention's efficiency and spatial understanding needed for high-quality generation.",

      "abstract": "Learning-based stereo matching models struggle in adverse weather conditions due to the scarcity of corresponding training data and the challenges in extracting discriminative features from degraded images. These limitations significantly hinder zero-shot generalization to out-of-distribution weather conditions. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{RobuSTereo}, a novel framework that enhances the zero-shot generalization of stereo matching models under adverse weather by addressing both data scarcity and feature extraction challenges. First, we introduce a diffusion-based simulation pipeline with a stereo consistency module, which generates high-quality stereo data tailored for adverse conditions. By training stereo matching models on our synthetic datasets, we reduce the domain gap between clean and degraded images, significantly improving the models' robustness to unseen weather conditions. The stereo consistency module ensures structural alignment across synthesized image pairs, preserving geometric integrity and enhancing depth estimation accuracy. Second, we design a robust feature encoder that combines a specialized ConvNet with a denoising transformer to extract stable and reliable features from degraded images. The ConvNet captures fine-grained local structures, while the denoising transformer refines global representations, effectively mitigating the impact of noise, low visibility, and weather-induced distortions. This enables more accurate disparity estimation even under challenging visual conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \\textbf{RobuSTereo} significantly improves the robustness and generalization of stereo matching models across diverse adverse weather scenarios.",

This constraint prevents models from fully exploiting sparse regimes, forcing awkward compromises. We propose Subpixel Placement of Tokens (SPoT), a novel tokenization strategy that positions tokens continuously within images, effectively sidestepping grid-based limitations. With our proposed oracle-guided search, we uncover substantial performance gains achievable with ideal subpixel token positioning, drastically reducing the number of tokens necessary for accurate predictions during inference. SPoT provides a new direction for flexible, efficient, and interpretable ViT architectures, redefining sparsity as a strategic advantage rather than an imposed limitation.",

This research concentrates on a specific type of these systems, based on cellular symport/antiport communication of chemicals.\n  Results in the literature show that systems of this type that also allow cell division can solve PSPACE problems. In our study, we investigate systems that use membrane separation instead of cell division, for which only limited results are available. Notably, it has been shown that any problem solvable by such systems in polynomial time falls within the complexity class P^(#P).\n  By implementing a system solving MIDSAT, a P^(#P)-complete problem, we demonstrate that the reverse inclusion is true as well, thus providing an exact characterization of the problem class solvable by P systems with symport/antiport and membrane separation.\n  Moreover, our implementation uses rules of length at most three. With this limit, systems were known to be able to solve NP-complete problems, whereas limiting the rules by length two, they characterize P.",

While Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) collocation points have traditionally been considered inferior to Legendre-Gauss (LG) and Legendre-Gauss-Radau (LGR) points in terms of convergence properties, this paper presents a rigorous re-examination of LGL-based methods. We introduce an augmented formulation that enhances the standard LGL collocation approach by incorporating an additional degree of freedom (DOF) into the interpolation structure. We demonstrate that this augmented formulation is mathematically equivalent to the integral formulation of the LGL collocation method. Through analytical derivation, we establish that the adjoint system in both the augmented differential and integral formulations corresponds to a Lobatto IIIB discontinuous collocation method for the costate vector, thereby resolving the previously reported convergence issues. Our comparative analysis of LG, LGR, and LGL collocation methods reveals significant advantages of the improved LGL approach in terms of discretized problem dimensionality and symplectic integration properties. Numerical examples validate our theoretical findings, demonstrating that the proposed LGL-based method achieves comparable accuracy to LG and LGR methods while offering superior computational performance for long-horizon optimal control problems due to the preservation of symplecticity.",

Traditional task-colocated RL frameworks suffer from significant scalability bottlenecks, while task-separated RL frameworks face challenges in complex dataflows and the corresponding resource idling and workload imbalance. Moreover, most existing frameworks are tightly coupled with LLM training or inference engines, making it difficult to support custom-designed engines. To address these challenges, we propose AsyncFlow, an asynchronous streaming RL framework for efficient post-training. Specifically, we introduce a distributed data storage and transfer module that provides a unified data management and fine-grained scheduling capability in a fully streamed manner. This architecture inherently facilitates automated pipeline overlapping among RL tasks and dynamic load balancing. Moreover, we propose a producer-consumer-based asynchronous workflow engineered to minimize computational idleness by strategically deferring parameter update process within staleness thresholds. Finally, the core capability of AsynFlow is architecturally decoupled from underlying training and inference engines and encapsulated by service-oriented user interfaces, offering a modular and customizable user experience. Extensive experiments demonstrate an average of 1.59 throughput improvement compared with state-of-the-art baseline. The presented architecture in this work provides actionable insights for next-generation RL training system designs.",

Current state-of-the-art methods either rely on dedicated image-matching, or pre-training of computer vision modules on relative pose estimation. In this paper, we study whether this task can be efficiently solved with end-to-end training of full agents with RL, as has been claimed by recent work. A positive answer would have impact beyond Embodied AI and allow training of relative pose estimation from reward for navigation alone. In a large study we investigate the effect of architectural choices like late fusion, channel stacking, space-to-depth projections and cross-attention, and their role in the emergence of relative pose estimators from navigation training. We show that the success of recent methods is influenced up to a certain extent by simulator settings, leading to shortcuts in simulation. However, we also show that these capabilities can be transferred to more realistic setting, up to some extend. We also find evidence for correlations between navigation performance and probed (emerging) relative pose estimation performance, an important sub skill.",

Its success is crucial for advancing applications in human behavior understanding, healthcare monitoring, and human-computer interaction. In this work, we propose FACET-VLM, a vision-language framework for 3D/4D FER that integrates multiview facial representation learning with semantic guidance from natural language prompts. FACET-VLM introduces three key components: Cross-View Semantic Aggregation (CVSA) for view-consistent fusion, Multiview Text-Guided Fusion (MTGF) for semantically aligned facial emotions, and a multiview consistency loss to enforce structural coherence across views. Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across multiple benchmarks, including BU-3DFE, Bosphorus, BU-4DFE, and BP4D-Spontaneous. We further extend FACET-VLM to 4D micro-expression recognition (MER) on the 4DME dataset, demonstrating strong performance in capturing subtle, short-lived emotional cues. The extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness and substantial contributions of each individual component within the framework. Overall, FACET-VLM offers a robust, extensible, and high-performing solution for multimodal FER in both posed and spontaneous settings.",

DLRMs' performance bottleneck is found in the embedding layers, which perform many random memory accesses to retrieve small embedding vectors from tables of various sizes. We propose the design of tailored data flows to speedup embedding look-ups. Namely, we propose four strategies to look up an embedding table effectively on one core, and a framework to automatically map the tables asymmetrically to the multiple cores of a SoC. We assess the effectiveness of our method using the Huawei Ascend AI accelerators, comparing it with the default Ascend compiler, and we perform high-level comparisons with Nvidia A100. Results show a speed-up varying from 1.5x up to 6.5x for real workload distributions, and more than 20x for extremely unbalanced distributions. Furthermore, the method proves to be much more independent of the query distribution than the baseline.",

      "abstract": "Existing post-training techniques for large language models are broadly categorized into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT). Each paradigm presents a distinct trade-off: SFT excels at mimicking demonstration data but can lead to problematic generalization as a form of behavior cloning. Conversely, RFT can significantly enhance a model's performance but is prone to learn unexpected behaviors, and its performance is highly sensitive to the initial policy. In this paper, we propose a unified view of these methods and introduce Prefix-RFT, a hybrid approach that synergizes learning from both demonstration and exploration. Using mathematical reasoning problems as a testbed, we empirically demonstrate that Prefix-RFT is both simple and effective. It not only surpasses the performance of standalone SFT and RFT but also outperforms parallel mixed-policy RFT methods. A key advantage is its seamless integration into existing open-source frameworks, requiring only minimal modifications to the standard RFT pipeline. Our analysis highlights the complementary nature of SFT and RFT, and validates that Prefix-RFT effectively harmonizes these two learning paradigms. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm the method's robustness to variations in the quality and quantity of demonstration data. We hope this work offers a new perspective on LLM post-training, suggesting that a unified paradigm that judiciously integrates demonstration and exploration could be a promising direction for future research.",

Different from the conventional SC-TCs, the proposed codes have simpler and deterministic coupling structures. Most notably, the coupling of HSC-BCCs is performed by re-encoding the whole coupling sequence in the component encoder of one time instant, rather than spreading the coupling bits to component encoders of multiple time instants. This simplification not only addresses the window decoding threshold loss issue in existing BCCs, but also allows the proposed codes to attain very close-to-capacity performance with a coupling memory as small as 2. Both theoretical and numerical results are provided to demonstrate the performance advantages of the proposed codes over existing spatially coupled codes.",

Drawing on HCI methodologies, participatory design, and care ethics, this workshop will provide a space for rethinking how academic communities can support inclusive networks. Through pre-workshop engagement, co-design activities, and reflection, participants will examine systemic gaps in networks and explore ways to embed care, equity, and sustainability into academic peer-support frameworks -- from informal, exclusionary models to structured, inclusive care-based ecosystems. At the end of the workshop, participants will co-develop design strategies for integrating care and resilience in academic ecosystems, resources for designing equitable support systems, and a peer network invested and committed to fostering a supportive academic community.",

We formalize exact input reconstruction as a discrete optimisation problem with a unique global minimum and introduce SODA, an efficient gradient-based algorithm that operates on a continuous relaxation of the input search space with periodic restarts and parameter decay. Through comprehensive experiments on LLMs ranging in size from 33M to 3B parameters, we demonstrate that SODA significantly outperforms existing approaches. We succeed in fully recovering 79.5% of shorter out-of-distribution inputs from next-token logits, without a single false positive, but struggle to extract private information from the outputs of longer (15+ token) input sequences. This suggests that standard deployment practices may currently provide adequate protection against malicious use of our method. Our code is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15539879.",

However, FedLLMs remains highly vulnerable to model poisoning attacks. This article first reviews recent model poisoning techniques and existing defense mechanisms for FedLLMs, highlighting critical limitations, particularly under non-IID text distributions. In particular, current defenses primarily utilize distance-based outlier detection or norm constraints, operating under the assumption that adversarial updates significantly diverge from benign statistics. This assumption can fail when facing adaptive attackers targeting billionparameter LLMs. Next, this article investigates emerging Graph Representation-Based Model Poisoning (GRMP), a novel attack paradigm that leverages higher-order correlations among honest client gradients to synthesize malicious updates indistinguishable from legitimate model updates. GRMP can effectively evade advanced defenses, resulting in substantial accuracy loss and performance degradation. Moreover, this article outlines a research roadmap emphasizing the importance of graph-aware secure aggregation methods, FedLLMs-specific vulnerability metrics, and evaluation frameworks to strengthen the robustness of future federated language model deployments.",

Hence, it is imperative to design methods to reduce reliance on such large models without significant degradation in output accuracy. The high computational cost of these models is often necessary only for a reduced set of challenging inputs, while lighter models can handle most simple ones. Thus, carefully combining properties of existing DNN models in a dynamic, input-based way opens opportunities to improve efficiency without impacting accuracy.\n  In this work, we introduce PERTINENCE, a novel online method designed to analyze the complexity of input features and dynamically select the most suitable model from a pre-trained set to process a given input effectively. To achieve this, we employ a genetic algorithm to explore the training space of an ML-based input dispatcher, enabling convergence towards the Pareto front in the solution space that balances overall accuracy and computational efficiency.\n  We showcase our approach on state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, as well as Vision Transformers (ViTs) trained on TinyImageNet dataset. We report results showing PERTINENCE's ability to provide alternative solutions to existing state-of-the-art models in terms of trade-offs between accuracy and number of operations. By opportunistically selecting among models trained for the same task, PERTINENCE achieves better or comparable accuracy with up to 36% fewer operations.",

Our model is based on constructing a new Riemannian metric on a two-dimensional projection plane, which is induced by the high-dimensional Euclidean metric on two-dimensional smooth submanifold and reflects the environmental information of the robot. The optimal path planning problem in high-dimensional space is therefore transformed into a geometric problem on the two-dimensional plane with new Riemannian metric. Based on the new Riemannian metric, we proposed an incremental algorithm RRT*-R on the projection plane. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is suitable for scenarios with uneven fields in multiple dimensions. The proposed algorithm can help the robot to effectively avoid areas with drastic changes in height, ground resistance and other environmental factors. More importantly, the RRT*-R algorithm shows better smoothness and optimization properties compared with the original RRT* algorithm using Euclidean distance in high-dimensional workspace. The length of the entire path by RRT*-R is a good approximation of the theoretical minimum geodesic distance on projection plane.",

While several causal discovery algorithms exist for learning causal models with latent confounders from data, they assume that the data is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and are not well-suited for learning from relational data. Similarly, existing relational causal discovery algorithms assume causal sufficiency, which is unrealistic for many real-world datasets. To address this gap, we propose RelFCI, a sound and complete causal discovery algorithm for relational data with latent confounders. Our work builds upon the Fast Causal Inference (FCI) and Relational Causal Discovery (RCD) algorithms and it defines new graphical models, necessary to support causal discovery in relational domains. We also establish soundness and completeness guarantees for relational d-separation with latent confounders. We present experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of RelFCI in identifying the correct causal structure in relational causal models with latent confounders.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose to incorporate the blackboard architecture into LLM multi-agent systems (MASs) so that (1) agents with various roles can share all the information and others' messages during the whole problem-solving process, (2) agents that will take actions are selected based on the current content of the blackboard, and (3) the selection and execution round is repeated until a consensus is reached on the blackboard. We develop the first implementation of this proposal and conduct experiments on commonsense knowledge, reasoning and mathematical datasets. The results show that our system can be competitive with the SOTA static and dynamic MASs by achieving the best average performance, and at the same time manage to spend less tokens. Our proposal has the potential to enable complex and dynamic problem-solving where well-defined structures or workflows are unavailable.",

      "abstract": "The proliferation of multimodal memes in the social media era demands that multimodal Large Language Models (mLLMs) effectively understand meme harmfulness. Existing benchmarks for assessing mLLMs on harmful meme understanding rely on accuracy-based, model-agnostic evaluations using static datasets. These benchmarks are limited in their ability to provide up-to-date and thorough assessments, as online memes evolve dynamically. To address this, we propose AdamMeme, a flexible, agent-based evaluation framework that adaptively probes the reasoning capabilities of mLLMs in deciphering meme harmfulness. Through multi-agent collaboration, AdamMeme provides comprehensive evaluations by iteratively updating the meme data with challenging samples, thereby exposing specific limitations in how mLLMs interpret harmfulness. Extensive experiments show that our framework systematically reveals the varying performance of different target mLLMs, offering in-depth, fine-grained analyses of model-specific weaknesses.

      "abstract": "Collision-free motion planning in complex outdoor environments relies heavily on perceiving the surroundings through exteroceptive sensors. A widely used approach represents the environment as a voxelized Euclidean distance field, where robots are typically approximated by spheres. However, for large-scale manipulators such as forestry cranes, which feature long and slender links, this conventional spherical approximation becomes inefficient and inaccurate. This work presents a novel collision detection algorithm specifically designed to exploit the elongated structure of such manipulators, significantly enhancing the computational efficiency of motion planning algorithms. Unlike traditional sphere decomposition methods, our approach not only improves computational efficiency but also naturally eliminates the need to fine-tune the approximation accuracy as an additional parameter. We validate the algorithm's effectiveness using real-world LiDAR data from a forestry crane application, as well as simulated environment data.",

This inverse problem is implemented as a nonlinear regression-type optimization problem, in which the simulation signals are fitted to the measurement signals. These signals consist of displacement responses in waveguides, focusing on hollow cylindrical geometries to enhance the simulation efficiency. To accelerate the optimization and reduce the number of model evaluations and wait times, we propose two novel methods. First, we introduce an adaptation of the Levenberg-Marquardt method derived from a geometrical interpretation of the least-squares optimization problem. Second, we introduce an improved objective function based on the autocorrelated envelopes of the measurement and simulation signals. Given that this study primarily relies on simulation data to quantify optimization convergence, we aggregate the expected ranges of realistic material parameters and derive their distributions to ensure the reproducibility of optimizations with proper measurements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our objective function modification and step adaptation for various materials with isotropic material symmetry by comparing them with a state-of-the-art optimization method. In all cases, our method reduces the total number of model evaluations, thereby shortening the time to identify the material parameters.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of anonymizing structured data is to protect the privacy of individuals in the data while retaining the statistical properties of the data. An important class of attack on anonymized data is attribute inference, where an attacker infers the value of an unknown attribute of a target individual given knowledge of one or more known attributes. A major limitation of recent attribute inference measures is that they do not take recall into account, only precision. It is often the case that attacks target only a fraction of individuals, for instance data outliers. Incorporating recall, however, substantially complicates the measure, because one must determine how to combine recall and precision in a composite measure for both the attack and baseline. This paper presents the design and implementation of an attribute inference measure that incorporates both precision and recall. Our design also improves on how the baseline attribute inference is computed. In experiments using a generic best row match attack on moderately-anonymized microdata, we show that in over 25\\% of the attacks, our approach correctly labeled the attack to be at risk while the prior approach incorrectly labeled the attack to be safe.",

      "abstract": "Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) tackles the challenging problem of categorizing unlabeled images into both known and novel classes within a partially labeled dataset, without prior knowledge of the number of unknown categories. Traditional methods often rely on rigid assumptions, such as predefining the number of classes, which limits their ability to handle the inherent variability and complexity of real-world data. To address these shortcomings, we propose AdaGCD, a cluster-centric contrastive learning framework that incorporates Adaptive Slot Attention (AdaSlot) into the GCD framework. AdaSlot dynamically determines the optimal number of slots based on data complexity, removing the need for predefined slot counts. This adaptive mechanism facilitates the flexible clustering of unlabeled data into known and novel categories by dynamically allocating representational capacity. By integrating adaptive representation with dynamic slot allocation, our method captures both instance-specific and spatially clustered features, improving class discovery in open-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on public and fine-grained datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework, emphasizing the advantages of leveraging spatial local information for category discovery in unlabeled image datasets.",

In this article, we propose a modification to wavelet-based SPN extraction. Rather than constructing the fingerprint as an image, we introduce the notion of a wavelet domain fingerprint. This avoids the final inversion step of the denoising algorithm and allows fingerprint comparisons to be made directly in the wavelet domain. As such, our modification streamlines the extraction and comparison process. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method not only achieves higher detection accuracy but can also significantly improve processing speed.",

We introduce StereoBias, a unique dataset labeled for bias and stereotype detection across five categories: religion, gender, socio-economic status, race, profession, and others, enabling a deeper study of their relationship. Our experiments compare encoder-only models and fine-tuned decoder-only models using QLoRA. While encoder-only models perform well, decoder-only models also show competitive results. Crucially, joint training on bias and stereotype detection significantly improves bias detection compared to training them separately. Additional experiments with sentiment analysis confirm that the improvements stem from the connection between bias and stereotypes, not multi-task learning alone. These findings highlight the value of leveraging stereotype information to build fairer and more effective AI systems.",

      "abstract": "There is justifiable interest in leveraging conversational AI (CAI) for health across the majority world, but to be effective, CAI must respond appropriately within culturally and linguistically diverse contexts. Therefore, we need ways to address the fact that current LLMs exclude many lived experiences globally. Various advances are underway which focus on top-down approaches and increasing training data. In this paper, we aim to complement these with a bottom-up locally-grounded approach based on qualitative data collected during participatory workshops in Latin America. Our goal is to construct a rich and human-centred understanding of: a) potential areas of cultural misalignment in digital health; b) regional perspectives on chatbots for health and c)strategies for creating culturally-appropriate CAI; with a focus on the understudied Latin American context. Our findings show that academic boundaries on notions of culture lose meaning at the ground level and technologies will need to engage with a broader framework; one that encapsulates the way economics, politics, geography and local logistics are entangled in cultural experience. To this end, we introduce a framework for 'Pluriversal Conversational AI for Health' which allows for the possibility that more relationality and tolerance, rather than just more data, may be called for.",

      "abstract": "We consider weakly supervised segmentation where only a fraction of pixels have ground truth labels (scribbles) and focus on a self-labeling approach optimizing relaxations of the standard unsupervised CRF/Potts loss on unlabeled pixels. While WSSS methods can directly optimize such losses via gradient descent, prior work suggests that higher-order optimization can improve network training by introducing hidden pseudo-labels and powerful CRF sub-problem solvers, e.g. graph cut. However, previously used hard pseudo-labels can not represent class uncertainty or errors, which motivates soft self-labeling. We derive a principled auxiliary loss and systematically evaluate standard and new CRF relaxations (convex and non-convex), neighborhood systems, and terms connecting network predictions with soft pseudo-labels. We also propose a general continuous sub-problem solver. Using only standard architectures, soft self-labeling consistently improves scribble-based training and outperforms significantly more complex specialized WSSS systems. It can outperform full pixel-precise supervision. Our general ideas apply to other weakly-supervised problems/systems.",

      "abstract": "Pruning is widely used to reduce the complexity of deep learning models, but its effects on interpretability and representation learning remain poorly understood. This paper investigates how pruning influences vision models across three key dimensions: (i) interpretability, (ii) unsupervised object discovery, and (iii) alignment with human perception. We first analyze different vision network architectures to examine how varying sparsity levels affect feature attribution interpretability methods. Additionally, we explore whether pruning promotes more succinct and structured representations, potentially improving unsupervised object discovery by discarding redundant information while preserving essential features. Finally, we assess whether pruning enhances the alignment between model representations and human perception, investigating whether sparser models focus on more discriminative features similarly to humans. Our findings also reveal the presence of sweet spots, where sparse models exhibit higher interpretability, downstream generalization and human alignment. However, these spots highly depend on the network architectures and their size in terms of trainable parameters. Our results suggest a complex interplay between these three dimensions, highlighting the importance of investigating when and how pruning benefits vision representations.",

To address this issue, we propose Spherical Diffusion Policy (SDP), an SE(3) equivariant diffusion policy that adapts trajectories according to 3D transformations of the scene. Such equivariance is achieved by embedding the states, actions, and the denoising process in spherical Fourier space. Additionally, we employ novel spherical FiLM layers to condition the action denoising process equivariantly on the scene embeddings. Lastly, we propose a spherical denoising temporal U-net that achieves spatiotemporal equivariance with computational efficiency. In the end, SDP is end-to-end SE(3) equivariant, allowing robust generalization across transformed 3D scenes. SDP demonstrates a large performance improvement over strong baselines in 20 simulation tasks and 5 physical robot tasks including single-arm and bi-manual embodiments.

      "abstract": "The learning rate is one of the most important hyperparameters in deep learning, and how to control it is an active area within both AutoML and deep learning research. Approaches for learning rate control span from classic optimization to online scheduling based on gradient statistics. This paper compares paradigms to assess the current state of learning rate control. We find that methods from multi-fidelity hyperparameter optimization, fixed-hyperparameter schedules, and hyperparameter-free learning often perform very well on selected deep learning tasks but are not reliable across settings. This highlights the need for algorithm selection methods in learning rate control, which have been neglected so far by both the AutoML and deep learning communities. We also observe a trend of hyperparameter optimization approaches becoming less effective as models and tasks grow in complexity, even when combined with multi-fidelity approaches for more expensive model trainings. A focus on more relevant test tasks and new promising directions like finetunable methods and meta-learning will enable the AutoML community to significantly strengthen its impact on this crucial factor in deep learning.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents an auto-optimization control framework for wave energy converters (WECs) to maximize energy generation under unknown and changing ocean conditions. The proposed control framework consists of two levels. The high-level controller operating at a longer time scale aims to maximize the average energy generation over several wave periods. The generated Power Take-Off (PTO) profile as the reference for the low-level physical system to follow. The new auto-optimization process leverages the parameterization of the non-stationary operation condition in WECs, establishing the relationship between the average energy generation and the key design parameters of the PTO force subject to the unknown wave parameters. The high-level controller is designed based on the concept of Dual Control for Exploration and Exploitation (DCEE) to quickly learn the unknown wave parameters by actively probing the ocean condition, while generating the optimal PTO profile. During this process, the uncertainty of the estimated wave condition is quantified and embedded in the optimization cost function to enable active learning. Simulation results under unknown regular and irregular waves demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of this novel auto-optimization WEC systems with active learning, outperforming model predictive control, extremum seeking and classic Bang-Bang control approaches.",

The method targets optimization problems with computationally demanding objective functions, for which direct optimization is often impractical due to expensive function evaluations. To address these challenges, we leverage a trust-region strategy, where the objective function is approximated by an efficient surrogate model within a local neighborhood of the current iterate. In particular, we construct the surrogate using Hermite kernel interpolation and define the trust-region based on bounds for the interpolation error. As mesh-free techniques, kernel-based methods are naturally suited for medium- to high-dimensional problems. Furthermore, the Hermite formulation incorporates gradient information, enabling precise gradient estimates that are crucial for many optimization algorithms. We prove that the proposed algorithm converges to a stationary point, and we demonstrate its effectiveness through numerical experiments, which illustrate the convergence behavior as well as the efficiency gains compared to direct optimization.",

Our work evaluates the ability of different LLMs to classify clauses as \"valid,\" \"unfair,\" or \"void\" under three legal context variants: no legal context, full-text sources of laws and court rulings, and distilled versions of these (referred to as examination guidelines). Results show that full-text sources moderately improve performance, while examination guidelines significantly enhance recall for void clauses and weighted F1-Score, reaching 80\\%. Despite these advancements, LLMs' performance when using full-text sources remains substantially below that of human lawyers. We contribute an extended dataset, including examination guidelines, referenced legal sources, and corresponding annotations, alongside our code and all log files.

      "abstract": "Generating realistic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs) remains a challenging task due to the difficulty of modeling detailed interaction dynamics. Existing methods treat human and object motions independently, resulting in physically implausible and causally inconsistent behaviors. In this work, we present HOI-Dyn, a novel framework that formulates HOI generation as a driver-responder system, where human actions drive object responses. At the core of our method is a lightweight transformer-based interaction dynamics model that explicitly predicts how objects should react to human motion. To further enforce consistency, we introduce a residual-based dynamics loss that mitigates the impact of dynamics prediction errors and prevents misleading optimization signals. The dynamics model is used only during training, preserving inference efficiency. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances the quality of HOI generation but also establishes a feasible metric for evaluating the quality of generated interactions.",

      "abstract": "Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a challenging task that aims to segment objects in an image based on natural language expressions. While prior studies have predominantly concentrated on improving vision-language interactions and achieving fine-grained localization, a systematic analysis of the fundamental bottlenecks in existing RIS frameworks remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose DeRIS, a novel framework that decomposes RIS into two key components: perception and cognition. This modular decomposition facilitates a systematic analysis of the primary bottlenecks impeding RIS performance. Our findings reveal that the predominant limitation lies not in perceptual deficiencies, but in the insufficient multi-modal cognitive capacity of current models. To mitigate this, we propose a Loopback Synergy mechanism, which enhances the synergy between the perception and cognition modules, thereby enabling precise segmentation while simultaneously improving robust image-text comprehension. Additionally, we analyze and introduce a simple non-referent sample conversion data augmentation to address the long-tail distribution issue related to target existence judgement in general scenarios. Notably, DeRIS demonstrates inherent adaptability to both non- and multi-referents scenarios without requiring specialized architectural modifications, enhancing its general applicability.

Nevertheless, 3D ViTs are particularly interesting for large medical imaging volumes due to their efficient self-supervised training within the masked autoencoder (MAE) framework, which enables the use of imaging data without the need for expensive manual annotations. intracranial arterial calcification (IAC) is an imaging biomarker visible on routinely acquired CT scans linked to neurovascular diseases such as stroke and dementia, and automated IAC quantification could enable their large-scale risk assessment. We pre-train ViTs with MAE and fine-tune them for IAC segmentation for the first time. To develop our models, we use highly heterogeneous data from a large clinical trial, the third International Stroke Trial (IST-3). We evaluate key aspects of MAE pre-trained ViTs in IAC segmentation, and analyse the clinical implications. We show: 1) our calibrated self-supervised ViT beats a strong supervised nnU-Net baseline by 3.2 Dice points, 2) low patch sizes are crucial for ViTs for IAC segmentation and interpolation upsampling with regular convolutions is preferable to transposed convolutions for ViT-based models, and 3) our ViTs increase robustness to higher slice thicknesses and improve risk group classification in a clinical scenario by 46%.

      "abstract": "Glaciers are losing ice mass at unprecedented rates, increasing the need for accurate, year-round monitoring to understand frontal ablation, particularly the factors driving the calving process. Deep learning models can extract calving front positions from Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery to track seasonal ice losses at the calving fronts of marine- and lake-terminating glaciers. The current state-of-the-art model relies on ImageNet-pretrained weights. However, they are suboptimal due to the domain shift between the natural images in ImageNet and the specialized characteristics of remote sensing imagery, in particular for Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery. To address this challenge, we propose two novel self-supervised multimodal pretraining techniques that leverage SSL4SAR, a new unlabeled dataset comprising 9,563 Sentinel-1 and 14 Sentinel-2 images of Arctic glaciers, with one optical image per glacier in the dataset. Additionally, we introduce a novel hybrid model architecture that combines a Swin Transformer encoder with a residual Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) decoder. When pretrained on SSL4SAR, this model achieves a mean distance error of 293 m on the \"CAlving Fronts and where to Find thEm\" (CaFFe) benchmark dataset, outperforming the prior best model by 67 m. Evaluating an ensemble of the proposed model on a multi-annotator study of the benchmark dataset reveals a mean distance error of 75 m, approaching the human performance of 38 m. This advancement enables precise monitoring of seasonal changes in glacier calving fronts.",

We consider a brick-and-mortar retail setting where shoppers are offered compensation to deliver time-sensitive online orders. To manage this process, we propose a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model that captures key uncertainties, including the stochastic arrival of orders and crowd-shippers, and the probabilistic acceptance of delivery offers. Our solution approach integrates Neural Approximate Dynamic Programming (NeurADP) for adaptive order-to-shopper assignment with a Deep Double Q-Network (DDQN) for dynamic pricing. This joint optimization strategy enables multi-drop routing and accounts for offer acceptance uncertainty, aligning more closely with real-world operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the integrated NeurADP + DDQN policy achieves notable improvements in delivery cost efficiency, with up to 6.7\\% savings over NeurADP with fixed pricing and approximately 18\\% over myopic baselines. We also show that allowing flexible delivery delays and enabling multi-destination routing further reduces operational costs by 8\\% and 17\\%, respectively. These findings underscore the advantages of dynamic, forward-looking policies in crowd-shipping systems and offer practical guidance for urban logistics operators.",

      "abstract": "Gradient-based optimization is the workhorse of deep learning, offering efficient and scalable training via backpropagation. However, its reliance on large volumes of labeled data raises privacy and security concerns such as susceptibility to data poisoning attacks and the risk of overfitting. In contrast, black box optimization methods, which treat the model as an opaque function, relying solely on function evaluations to guide optimization, offer a promising alternative in scenarios where data access is restricted, adversarial risks are high, or overfitting is a concern. However, black box methods also pose significant challenges, including poor scalability to high-dimensional parameter spaces, as prevalent in large language models (LLMs), and high computational costs due to reliance on numerous model evaluations. This paper introduces BBoxER, an evolutionary black-box method for LLM post-training that induces an information bottleneck via implicit compression of the training data. Leveraging the tractability of information flow, we provide strong theoretical bounds on generalization, differential privacy, susceptibility to data poisoning attacks, and robustness to extraction attacks. BBoxER operates on top of pre-trained LLMs, offering a lightweight and modular enhancement suitable for deployment in restricted or privacy-sensitive environments, in addition to non-vacuous generalization guarantees. In experiments with LLMs, we demonstrate empirically that Retrofitting methods are able to learn, showing how a few iterations of BBoxER improve performance and generalize well on a benchmark of reasoning datasets. This positions BBoxER as an attractive add-on on top of gradient-based optimization.",

In this concept, two connecting J-shape tunnels are first drilled through pedicles of vertebra using the CT-SDR. Next, two FPSs are passed through this tunnel and bone cement is then injected through the cannulated region of the FPS to form an augmented bridge between two pedicles and reinforce strength of the fixated spine. To experimentally analyze and study the feasibility of AB-SF technique, we first used our robotic system (i.e., a CT-SDR integrated with a robotic arm) to create two different fixation scenarios in which two J-shape tunnels, forming a bridge, were drilled at different depth of a vertebral phantom. Next, we implanted two FPSs within the drilled tunnels and then successfully simulated the bone cement augmentation process.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interests in encoding images as discrete tokens and leveraging autoregressive (AR) frameworks for visual generation. However, the quantization process in AR-based visual generation models inherently introduces information loss that degrades image fidelity. To mitigate this limitation, recent studies have explored to autoregressively predict continuous tokens. Unlike discrete tokens that reside in a structured and bounded space, continuous representations exist in an unbounded, high-dimensional space, making density estimation more challenging and increasing the risk of generating out-of-distribution artifacts. Based on the above findings, this work introduces DisCon (Discrete-Conditioned Continuous Autoregressive Model), a novel framework that reinterprets discrete tokens as conditional signals rather than generation targets. By modeling the conditional probability of continuous representations conditioned on discrete tokens, DisCon circumvents the optimization challenges of continuous token modeling while avoiding the information loss caused by quantization. DisCon achieves a gFID score of 1.38 on ImageNet 256$\\times$256 generation, outperforming state-of-the-art autoregressive approaches by a clear margin.",

We show that the problem is NP-hard even on two machines and two distinct processing times. For unit-time jobs, the problem becomes NP-hard when the number of machines increases to three. We also identify polynomial-time solvable cases for specific classes of conflict graphs. For the general problem, we propose mathematical models, lower bounds, and a genetic algorithm.

      "abstract": "Although generative models have made remarkable progress in recent years, their use in critical applications has been hindered by their incapacity to reliably evaluate sample quality. Quality refers to at least two complementary concepts: fidelity and coverage. Current quality metrics often lack reliable, interpretable values due to an absence of calibration or insufficient robustness to outliers. To address these shortcomings, we introduce two novel metrics, Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage. By clipping individual sample contributions and, for fidelity, the radii of nearest neighbor balls, our metrics prevent out-of-distribution samples from biasing the aggregated values. Through analytical and empirical calibration, these metrics exhibit linear score degradation as the proportion of poor samples increases. Thus, they can be straightforwardly interpreted as equivalent proportions of good samples. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage outperform existing methods in terms of robustness, sensitivity, and interpretability for evaluating generative models.",

Superposition coding (SC) and successive interference cancellation (SIC) techniques are utilized for the integrated navigation and communication (INAC) networks, and the composed navigation and communication signals are reflected or transmitted to ground users or indoor users located in urban canyons. To meet diverse application needs, navigation-oriented (NO)-INAC and communication-oriented (CO)-INAC have been developed, each tailored according to distinct power allocation factors. We then proposed two algorithms, namely navigation-prioritized-algorithm (NPA) and communication-prioritized-algorithm (CPA), to improve the navigation or communication performance by selecting the satellite with the optimized position dilution of precision (PDoP) or with the best channel gain. The effectiveness of the proposed STAR-RIS-aided INAC network is quantified by analyzing the positioning error for navigation services and by evaluating communication performance through achievable ergodic rate metrics. Our satellite selection approach indicates that: the positioning services at the urban canyon users can be completed with the aid of STAR-RIS. 2) Additionally, it is observed that while a single STAR-RIS array can extend the navigational link, it fails to serve users in indoor scenarios, highlighting a limitation in the current system design.",

To support analysts in staying abreast of emerging attack patterns, there is a need for ICS datasets that reflect indicators representative of contemporary cyber threats. To address this, we conduct two ICS cyberattack simulations to showcase the impact of trending ICS cyberattacks on a railway cyber range that resembles the railway infrastructure. The attack scenario is designed to blend trending attack trends with attack patterns observed from historical ICS incidents.

The averaged $J_2$ orbital parameters that describe the drift and periodic orbital motion were derived along with their target values to achieve a distributed space structure in a decentralized manner. This enabled the design of a distance-based orbital stabilizer to ensure autonomous deployment into a monolithic formation of a coplanar equidistant configuration on a user-defined orbital plane. Continuous formation control was assumed to be achieved through fuel-free actuation, such as satellite magnetic field interaction and differential aerodynamic forces, thereby maintaining long-term formation stability without thruster usage. A major challenge for such actuation systems is the potential loss of control capability due to increasing inter-satellite distances resulting from unstable orbital dynamics, particularly for autonomous satellite swarms. To mitigate this risk, our decentralized deployment controller minimized drift distance during unexpected communication outages. As a case study, we consider the deployment of palm-sized satellites into a coplanar equidistant formation in a $J_2$-perturbed orbit. Moreover, centralized grouping strategies are presented.",

Using interval analysis, coupled with the computational power and architecture of GPU, the method iteratively rules out the regions in the search domain where the global minimum cannot exist and leaves a finite set of regions where the global minimum must exist. For effectiveness, because of the rigor of interval analysis, the method is guaranteed to enclose the global minimum of the nonlinear function even in the presence of rounding errors. For efficiency, the method employs a novel GPU-based single program, single data parallel programming style to circumvent major GPU performance bottlenecks, and a variable cycling technique is also integrated into the method to reduce computational cost when minimizing large-scale nonlinear functions. The method is validated by minimizing 10 multimodal benchmark test functions with scalable dimensions, including the well-known Ackley function, Griewank function, Levy function, and Rastrigin function. These benchmark test functions represent grand challenges of global optimization, and enclosing the guaranteed global minimum of these benchmark test functions with more than 80 dimensions has not been reported in the literature. Our method completely searches the feasible domain and successfully encloses the guaranteed global minimum of these 10 benchmark test functions with up to 10,000 dimensions using only one GPU in a reasonable computation time, far exceeding the reported results in the literature due to the unique method design and implementation based on GPU architecture.",

This survey provides a comprehensive review and critical analysis of GenAI in network optimization. We focus on the two dominant paradigms of GenAI including generative diffusion models (GDMs) and large pre-trained models (LPTMs), and organize our discussion around a categorization we introduce, dividing network optimization problems into two primary formulations: one-shot optimization and Markov decision process (MDP). We first trace key works, including foundational contributions from the AI community, and categorize current efforts in network optimization. We also review frontier applications of GDMs and LPTMs in other networking tasks, providing additional context. Furthermore, we present theoretical generalization bounds for GDMs in both one-shot and MDP settings, offering insights into the fundamental factors affecting model performance. Most importantly, we reflect on the overestimated perception of GenAI's general capabilities and caution against the all-in-one illusion it may convey. We highlight critical limitations, including difficulties in constraint satisfying, limited concept understanding, and the inherent probabilistic nature of outputs. We also propose key future directions, such as bridging the gap between generation and optimization. Although they are increasingly integrated in implementations, they differ fundamentally in both objectives and underlying mechanisms, necessitating a deeper understanding of their theoretical connections. Ultimately, this survey aims to provide a structured overview and a deeper insight into the strengths, limitations, and potential of GenAI in network optimization.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present a deterministic variant of Chan's randomized partition tree [Discret. Comput. Geom., 2012]. This result leads to numerous applications. In particular, for $d$-dimensional simplex range counting (for any constant $d \\ge 2$), we construct a data structure using $O(n)$ space and $O(n^{1+\\epsilon})$ preprocessing time, such that each query can be answered in $o(n^{1-1/d})$ time (specifically, $O(n^{1-1/d} / \\log^{\\Omega(1)} n)$ time), thereby breaking an $\\Omega(n^{1-1/d})$ lower bound known for the semigroup setting. Notably, our approach does not rely on any bit-packing techniques. We also obtain deterministic improvements for several other classical problems, including simplex range stabbing counting and reporting, segment intersection detection, counting and reporting, ray-shooting among segments, and more. Similar to Chan's original randomized partition tree, we expect that additional applications will emerge in the future, especially in situations where deterministic results are preferred.",

      "abstract": "The integration of machine learning (ML) into spatial design holds immense potential for optimizing space utilization, enhancing functionality, and streamlining design processes. ML can automate tasks, predict performance outcomes, and tailor spaces to user preferences. However, the emotional, cultural, and aesthetic dimensions of design remain crucial for creating spaces that truly resonate with users-elements that ML alone cannot address. The key challenge lies in harmonizing data-driven efficiency with the nuanced, subjective aspects of design. This paper proposes a human-machine collaboration framework to bridge this gap. An effective framework should recognize that while ML enhances design efficiency through automation and prediction, it must be paired with human creativity to ensure spaces are emotionally engaging and culturally relevant. Human designers contribute intuition, empathy, and cultural insight, guiding ML-generated solutions to align with users' emotional and cultural needs. Additionally, we explore how various ML models can be integrated with human-centered design principles. These models can automate design generation and optimization, while human designers refine the outputs to ensure emotional resonance and aesthetic appeal. Through case studies in office and residential design, we illustrate how this framework fosters both creativity and cultural relevance. By merging ML with human creativity, spatial design can achieve a balance of efficiency and emotional impact, resulting in environments that are both functional and deeply human.",

One of the major challenges is the automated discrimination between clean and dirty solar panels. This paper presents a novel Dual Ensemble Neural Network (DENN) to classify solar panels using image-based features. The suggested approach utilizes the advantages offered by various ensemble models by integrating them into a dual framework, aimed at improving both classification accuracy and robustness. The DENN model is evaluated in comparison to current ensemble methods, showcasing its superior performance across a range of assessment metrics. The proposed approach performs the best compared to other methods and reaches state-of-the-art accuracy on experimental results for the Deep Solar Eye dataset, effectively serving predictive maintenance purposes in solar energy systems. It reveals the potential of hybrid ensemble learning techniques to further advance the prospects of automated solar panel inspections as a scalable solution to real-world challenges.",

To achieve this, we first enhanced our previously designed concentric tube Steerable Drilling Robot (CT-SDR) to facilitate steerable drilling across all vertebral levels of the spinal column. Additionally, we propose a four-Phase calibration, registration, and navigation procedure to perform realistic SF procedures on a spine holder phantom by integrating the CT-SDR with a seven-degree-of-freedom robotic manipulator.

      "abstract": "Symbiotic Backscatter Communication (SBC) has emerged as a spectrum-efficient and low-power communication technology, where backscatter devices (BDs) modulate and reflect incident radio frequency (RF) signals from primary transmitters (PTs). While previous studies have assumed a circularly symmetric complex Gaussian (CSCG) distribution for the BD's signal, this assumption may not be practical because the high complexity of generating CSCG signals is not supported by the low-cost BD. In this paper, we address this gap by investigating SBC for two low-complexity modulation schemes, i.e., $M$-ary amplitude-shift keying (MASK) and $M$-ary phase-shift keying (MPSK), where BD's signals inherently deviate from CSCG distribution. Our goal is to derive the achievable rate of the PT and BD under the MASK/MPSK and to design MASK/MPSK modulation scheme for maximizing the PT's rate. Towards this end, we first derive the expressions of both the PT's rate and BD's rate. Theoretical results reveal that whether or not the BD improves the PT's rate depends on the phase of MASK/MPSK modulation, while the BD's rate is independent of this phase. We then formulate two optimization problems to maximize the PT's rate by adjusting the phase under the MASK and MPSK modulation schemes, respectively, and derive the optimal phases for each modulation scheme in closed forms. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimal phase of MASK/MPSK can ensure an improvement in the PT's rate, and reveal that a low-order ASK modulation is better than a low-order PSK for the BD in terms of improving PT's rate, especially when the direct link is not significantly weaker than the backscatter link in SBC.",

      "abstract": "To mitigate the loss of satellite navigation signals in urban canyons and indoor environments, we propose an active simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (ASTARS) empowered satellite positioning approach. Deployed on building structures, ASTARS reflects navigation signals to outdoor receivers in urban canyons and transmits signals indoors to bypass obstructions, providing high-precision positioning services to receivers in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) areas. The path between ASTARS and the receiver is defined as the extended line-of-sight (ELoS) path and an improved carrier phase observation equation is derived to accommodate that. The receiver compensates for its clock bias through network time synchronization, corrects the actual signal path distance to the satellite-to-receiver distance through a distance correction algorithm, and determines its position by using the least squares (LS) method. Mathematical modeling of the errors introduced by the proposed method is conducted, followed by simulation analysis to assess their impact. Simulation results show that: 1) in areas where GNSS signals are blocked, with time synchronization accuracy within a 10 ns error range, the proposed method provides positioning services with errors not exceeding 4 m for both indoor and outdoor receivers, outperforming conventional NLoS methods with positioning errors of more than 7 m; 2) the additional errors introduced by the proposed method do not exceed 3 m for time synchronization errors within 10 ns, which includes the phase shift, beamwidth error, time synchronization errors, and satellite distribution errors, outperforming traditional NLoS methods, which typically produce positioning errors greater than 5 m.",

We show that linear probes can separate real-world evaluation and deployment prompts, suggesting that current models internally represent this distinction. We also find that current safety evaluations are correctly classified by the probes, suggesting that they already appear artificial or inauthentic to models. Our findings underscore the importance of ensuring trustworthy evaluations and understanding deceptive capabilities. More broadly, our work showcases how model internals may be leveraged to support blackbox methods in safety audits, especially for future models more competent at evaluation awareness and deception.",

This study examined compliance with DSA requirements, focusing on Instagram as a case study. We develop and apply a multi-level consistency framework to evaluate DSA compliance. Our findings contribute to the broader discussion on empirically-based regulation, providing insight into how researchers, regulators, auditors and platforms can better utilize DSA mechanisms to improve reporting and enforcement quality and accountability. This work underscores that consistency can help detect potential compliance failures.

      "abstract": "Vision transformers (ViTs) have rapidly gained prominence in medical imaging tasks such as disease classification, segmentation, and detection due to their superior accuracy compared to conventional deep learning models. However, due to their size and complex interactions via the self-attention mechanism, they are not well understood. In particular, it is unclear whether the representations produced by such models are semantically meaningful. In this paper, using a projected gradient-based algorithm, we show that their representations are not semantically meaningful and they are inherently vulnerable to small changes. Images with imperceptible differences can have very different representations; on the other hand, images that should belong to different semantic classes can have nearly identical representations. Such vulnerability can lead to unreliable classification results; for example, unnoticeable changes cause the classification accuracy to be reduced by over 60\\%. %. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically demonstrate this fundamental lack of semantic meaningfulness in ViT representations for medical image classification, revealing a critical challenge for their deployment in safety-critical systems.",

      "abstract": "To address the ill-posedness of the inverse source problem for the one-dimensional stochastic Helmholtz equations without attenuation, this study develops a novel computational framework designed to mitigate this inherent challenge at the numerical implementation level. For the stochastic wave equation driven by a finite-jump L\\'evy process (assuming that its jump amplitude obeys a Gaussian distribution and the jump time interval obeys a Poisson distribution), this paper firstly establish the existence of a mild solution to its direct problem satisfying a particular stability estimate. Building upon these theoretical foundations, we further investigate the well-posedness of the inverse problem and develop a methodology to reconstruct the unknown source terms $f$ and $g$ using the data of the wave field at the final time point $u(x,T)$. This work not only provides rigorous theoretical analysis and effective numerical schemes for solving inverse source problems in these two specific classes of stochastic wave equations, but also offers new perspectives and methodological approaches for addressing a broader range of wave propagation inverse problems characterized by non-Gaussian stochastic properties. The proposed framework demonstrates significant relevance for characterizing physical phenomena influenced by jump-type stochastic perturbations, offering promising applications in diverse domains including but not limited to seismic wave propagation analysis and financial market volatility modeling.",

This paper seeks to understand how such models behave when input streams present conflicting information. Focusing specifically on vision-language models, we provide inconsistent inputs (e.g., an image of a dog paired with the caption \"A photo of a cat\") and ask the model to report the information present in one of the specific modalities (e.g., \"What does the caption say / What is in the image?\"). We find that models often favor one modality over the other, e.g., reporting the image regardless of what the caption says, but that different models differ in which modality they favor. We find evidence that the behaviorally preferred modality is evident in the internal representational structure of the model, and that specific attention heads can restructure the representations to favor one modality over the other. Moreover, we find modality-agnostic \"router heads\" which appear to promote answers about the modality requested in the instruction, and which can be manipulated or transferred in order to improve performance across datasets and modalities. Together, the work provides essential steps towards identifying and controlling if and how models detect and resolve conflicting signals within complex multimodal environments.",

In this paper, we propose a new Segmented Gaussian Pyramid (SGP) attack method to enhance the transferability, particularly against defense models. Unlike existing methods that generally focus on single-scale images, our approach employs Gaussian filtering and three types of downsampling to construct a series of multi-scale examples. Then, the gradients of the loss function with respect to each scale are computed, and their average is used to determine the adversarial perturbations. The proposed SGP can be considered an input transformation with high extensibility that is easily integrated into most existing adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that in contrast to the state-of-the-art methods, SGP significantly enhances attack success rates against black-box defense models, with average attack success rates increasing by 2.3% to 32.6%, based only on transferability.",

Existing approaches typically fine-tune pretrained generative models or apply LoRA-based adaptations for individual subjects. However, these methods struggle with multi-subject personalization, as combining independently adapted modules often requires complex re-tuning or joint optimization. We present FreeLoRA, a simple and generalizable framework that enables training-free fusion of subject-specific LoRA modules for multi-subject personalization. Each LoRA module is adapted on a few images of a specific subject using a Full Token Tuning strategy, where it is applied across all tokens in the prompt to encourage weakly supervised token-content alignment. At inference, we adopt Subject-Aware Inference, activating each module only on its corresponding subject tokens. This enables training-free fusion of multiple personalized subjects within a single image, while mitigating overfitting and mutual interference between subjects. Extensive experiments show that FreeLoRA achieves strong performance in both subject fidelity and prompt consistency.",

While recent neural network architectures have successfully integrated classical numerical principles into learned models, most rely on prior knowledge of the governing equations or assume a fixed discretization. Our approach removes this dependency by embedding entropy-stable design principles into the learning process itself, enabling the discovery of physically consistent dynamics in a fully data-driven setting. By jointly learning both the numerical flux function and a corresponding entropy, the proposed method ensures conservation and entropy dissipation, critical for long-term stability and fidelity in the system of hyperbolic conservation laws. Numerical results demonstrate that the method achieves stability and conservation over extended time horizons and accurately captures shock propagation speeds, even without oracle access to future-time solution profiles in the training data.",

      "abstract": "3D Visual Question-Answering (3D VQA) is pivotal for models to perceive the physical world and perform spatial reasoning. Answer-centric supervision is a commonly used training method for 3D VQA models. Many models that utilize this strategy have achieved promising results in 3D VQA tasks. However, the answer-centric approach only supervises the final output of models and allows models to develop reasoning pathways freely. The absence of supervision on the reasoning pathway enables the potential for developing superficial shortcuts through common patterns in question-answer pairs. Moreover, although slow-thinking methods advance large language models, they suffer from underthinking. To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{HCNQA}, a 3D VQA model leveraging a hierarchical concentration narrowing supervision method. By mimicking the human process of gradually focusing from a broad area to specific objects while searching for answers, our method guides the model to perform three phases of concentration narrowing through hierarchical supervision. By supervising key checkpoints on a general reasoning pathway, our method can ensure the development of a rational and effective reasoning pathway. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively ensure that the model develops a rational reasoning pathway and performs better.

However, due to the inherent imbalance in trajectory distributions, tail data in natural datasets often represents more complex and hazardous scenarios. Existing studies typically rely solely on a base model's prediction error, without considering the diversity and uncertainty of long-tail trajectory patterns. We propose an adaptive momentum and decoupled contrastive learning framework (AMD), which integrates unsupervised and supervised contrastive learning strategies. By leveraging an improved momentum contrast learning (MoCo-DT) and decoupled contrastive learning (DCL) module, our framework enhances the model's ability to recognize rare and complex trajectories. Additionally, we design four types of trajectory random augmentation methods and introduce an online iterative clustering strategy, allowing the model to dynamically update pseudo-labels and better adapt to the distributional shifts in long-tail data. We propose three different criteria to define long-tail trajectories and conduct extensive comparative experiments on the nuScenes and ETH$/$UCY datasets. The results show that AMD not only achieves optimal performance in long-tail trajectory prediction but also demonstrates outstanding overall prediction accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Automatic medical coding has the potential to ease documentation and billing processes. For this task, transparency plays an important role for medical coders and regulatory bodies, which can be achieved using explainability methods. However, the evaluation of these approaches has been mostly limited to short text and binary settings due to a scarcity of annotated data. Recent efforts by Cheng et al. (2023) have introduced the MDACE dataset, which provides a valuable resource containing code evidence in clinical records. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the MDACE dataset and perform plausibility evaluation of current explainable medical coding systems from an applied perspective. With this, we contribute to a deeper understanding of automatic medical coding and evidence extraction. Our findings reveal that ground truth evidence aligns with code descriptions to a certain degree. An investigation into state-of-the-art approaches shows a high overlap with ground truth evidence. We propose match measures and highlight success and failure cases. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for developing and evaluating explainable medical coding systems.",

The dataset consists of 4,326 audio samples from 52 different TTS systems and human voices and is, up to our knowledge, the first of its kind in Spanish. To label the audios, a subjective test was designed based on the ITU-T Rec. P.807 standard and completed by 92 participants. Furthermore, the utility of the collected dataset was validated by training automatic naturalness prediction systems. We explored two approaches: fine-tuning an existing model originally trained for English, and training small downstream networks on top of frozen self-supervised speech models. Our models achieve a mean absolute error of 0.8 on a five-point MOS scale. Further analysis demonstrates the quality and diversity of the developed dataset, and its potential to advance TTS research in Spanish.",

However, their widespread adoption remains limited by the reliance on GPU-based training. In this work, we propose a theoretically grounded approach to LoRA fine-tuning designed specifically for users with limited computational resources, particularly those restricted to standard laptop CPUs. Our method learns a meta-operator that maps any input dataset, represented as a probability distribution, to a set of LoRA weights by leveraging a large bank of pre-trained adapters for the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model. Instead of performing new gradient-based updates, our pipeline constructs adapters via lightweight combinations of existing LoRAs directly on CPU. While the resulting adapters do not match the performance of GPU-trained counterparts, they consistently outperform the base Mistral model on downstream tasks, offering a practical and accessible alternative to traditional GPU-based fine-tuning.",

This paper introduces a privacy-preserving platform by which manufacturers may safely share their data with researchers through secure methods, so that those researchers then create innovative tools to solve the manufacturers' real-world problems, and then provide tools that execute solutions back onto the platform for others to use with privacy and confidentiality guarantees. We illustrate this problem through a particular use case which addresses an important problem in the large-scale manufacturing of food crystals, which is that quality control relies on image analysis tools. Previous to our research, food crystals in the images were manually counted, which required substantial and time-consuming human efforts, but we have developed and deployed a crystal analysis tool which makes this process both more rapid and accurate. The tool enables automatic characterization of the crystal size distribution and numbers from microscope images while the natural imperfections from the sample preparation are automatically removed; a machine learning model to count high resolution translucent crystals and agglomeration of crystals was also developed to aid in these efforts. The resulting algorithm was then packaged for real-world use on the factory floor via a web-based app secured through the originating privacy-preserving platform, allowing manufacturers to use it while keeping their proprietary data secure. After demonstrating this full process, future directions are also explored.",

These constraints prevent medical screws from following anatomically optimal pathways and force clinicians to fixate screws in linear trajectories. This suboptimal approach, combined with the unnatural placement of the excessively long screws, lead to complications such as screw misplacement, extended surgery times, and increased radiation exposure due to repeated X-ray images taken ensure to safety of procedure. To address these challenges, in this paper, we present the design and development of a unique 4 degree-of-freedom (DoF) pelvic concentric tube steerable drilling robot (pelvic CT-SDR). The pelvic CT-SDR is capable of creating long S-shaped drilling trajectories that follow the natural curvatures of the pelvic anatomy.

Our method efficiently distills a high-capacity multi-task agent (317M parameters) into a compact model (1M parameters) on the MT30 benchmark, significantly improving performance across diverse tasks. Our distilled model achieves a state-of-the-art normalized score of 28.45, surpassing the original 1M parameter model score of 18.93. This improvement demonstrates the ability of our distillation technique to capture and consolidate complex multi-task knowledge.

From a theoretical perspective: (i) we establish permutation and equivalence invariance results, demonstrating that the method produces outputs that are stable under reordering of clauses and variables; (ii) we identify a theoretical limitation, showing that for a class of formulae called foldable formulae, standard GNNs cannot always distinguish satisfiable from unsatisfiable instances; (iii) we prove a universal approximation theorem, establishing that with Random Node Initialization (RNI), the method can approximate SAT solving to arbitrary precision on finite datasets, that is, the GNN becomes approximately sound and complete on such datasets. Furthermore, we show that for unfoldable formulae, the same approximation guarantee can be achieved without the need for RNI.

      "abstract": "Automated Program Repair (APR) attempts to fix software bugs without human intervention, which plays a crucial role in software development and maintenance. Recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), a rapidly increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed with remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based APR techniques typically adopt trial-and-error strategies, which suffer from two major drawbacks: (1) inherently limited patch effectiveness due to local exploration, and (2) low search efficiency due to redundant exploration. In this paper, we propose APRMCTS, which uses iterative tree search to improve LLM-based APR. APRMCTS incorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into patch searching by performing a global evaluation of the explored patches and selecting the most promising one for subsequent refinement and generation. APRMCTS effectively resolves the problems of falling into local optima and thus helps improve the efficiency of patch searching. Our experiments on 835 bugs from Defects4J demonstrate that, when integrated with GPT-3.5, APRMCTS can fix a total of 201 bugs, which outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines. Besides, APRMCTS helps GPT-4o-mini, GPT-3.5, Yi-Coder-9B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B to fix 30, 27, 37, and 28 more bugs, respectively. More importantly, APRMCTS boasts a significant performance advantage while employing small patch size (16 and 32), notably fewer than the 500 and 10,000 patches adopted in previous studies. In terms of cost, compared to existing state-of-the-art LLM-based APR methods, APRMCTS has time and monetary costs of less than 20% and 50%, respectively. Our extensive study demonstrates that APRMCTS exhibits good effectiveness and efficiency, with particular advantages in addressing complex bugs.",

      "abstract": "Edge devices for temporal processing demand models that capture both short- and long- range dynamics under tight memory constraints. While Transformers excel at sequence modeling, their quadratic memory scaling with sequence length makes them impractical for such settings. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) offer constant memory but train sequentially, and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), though efficient, scale memory with kernel size. To address this, we propose mGRADE (mininally Gated Recurrent Architecture with Delay Embedding), a hybrid-memory system that integrates a temporal 1D-convolution with learnable spacings followed by a minimal gated recurrent unit (minGRU). This design allows the convolutional layer to realize a flexible delay embedding that captures rapid temporal variations, while the recurrent module efficiently maintains global context with minimal memory overhead. We validate our approach on two synthetic tasks, demonstrating that mGRADE effectively separates and preserves multi-scale temporal features. Furthermore, on challenging pixel-by-pixel image classification benchmarks, mGRADE consistently outperforms both pure convolutional and pure recurrent counterparts using approximately 20% less memory footprint, highlighting its suitability for memory-constrained temporal processing at the edge. This highlights mGRADE's promise as an efficient solution for memory-constrained multi-scale temporal processing at the edge.",

      "abstract": "To detect distribution shifts and improve model safety, many out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods rely on the predictive uncertainty or features of supervised models trained on in-distribution data. In this paper, we critically re-examine this popular family of OOD detection procedures, and we argue that these methods are fundamentally answering the wrong questions for OOD detection. There is no simple fix to this misalignment, since a classifier trained only on in-distribution classes cannot be expected to identify OOD points; for instance, a cat-dog classifier may confidently misclassify an airplane if it contains features that distinguish cats from dogs, despite generally appearing nothing alike. We find that uncertainty-based methods incorrectly conflate high uncertainty with being OOD, while feature-based methods incorrectly conflate far feature-space distance with being OOD. We show how these pathologies manifest as irreducible errors in OOD detection and identify common settings where these methods are ineffective. Additionally, interventions to improve OOD detection such as feature-logit hybrid methods, scaling of model and data size, epistemic uncertainty representation, and outlier exposure also fail to address this fundamental misalignment in objectives. We additionally consider unsupervised density estimation and generative models for OOD detection, which we show have their own fundamental limitations.",

Departing from the seminal definition by Gelfond and Lifschitz in 1988 for simple normal logic programs, various answer set semantics have been proposed for extensions. We consider two important questions: (1) Should the minimal model property, constraint monotonicity and foundedness as defined in the literature be mandatory conditions for an answer set semantics in general? (2) If not, what other properties could be considered as general principles for answer set semantics? We address the two questions. First, it seems that the three aforementioned conditions may sometimes be too strong, and we illustrate with examples that enforcing them may exclude expected answer sets. Second, we evolve the Gelfond answer set (GAS) principles for answer set construction by refining the Gelfond's rationality principle to well-supportedness, minimality w.r.t. negation by default and minimality w.r.t. epistemic negation. The principle of well-supportedness guarantees that every answer set is constructible from if-then rules obeying a level mapping and is thus free of circular justification, while the two minimality principles ensure that the formalism minimizes knowledge both at the level of answer sets and of world views. Third, to embody the refined GAS principles, we extend the notion of well-supportedness substantially to answer sets and world views, respectively. Fourth, we define new answer set semantics in terms of the refined GAS principles. Fifth, we use the refined GAS principles as an alternative baseline to intuitively assess the existing answer set semantics. Finally, we analyze the computational complexity.",

Existing approaches typically rely on a single RGB image, limiting reconstruction accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel multi-image-to-hyperspectral reconstruction (MI-HSR) framework that leverages a triple-camera smartphone system, where two lenses are equipped with carefully selected spectral filters. Our configuration, grounded in theoretical and empirical analysis, enables richer and more diverse spectral observations than conventional single-camera setups. To support this new paradigm, we introduce Doomer, the first dataset for MI-HSR, comprising aligned images from three smartphone cameras and a hyperspectral reference camera across diverse scenes. We show that the proposed HSR model achieves consistent improvements over existing methods on the newly proposed benchmark. In a nutshell, our setup allows 30% towards more accurately estimated spectra compared to an ordinary RGB camera. Our findings suggest that multi-view spectral filtering with commodity hardware can unlock more accurate and practical hyperspectral imaging solutions.",

In contrast to prior approaches, such as AdaLoRA, that rely on first-order (linearized) approximations of the loss function, SubLoRA utilizes second-order information to capture the potentially complex loss landscape by incorporating the Hessian matrix. We show that the linearization becomes inaccurate and ill-conditioned when the LoRA parameters have been well optimized, motivating the need for a more reliable and nuanced second-order formulation. To this end, we reformulate the rank determination problem as a combinatorial optimization problem with a quadratic objective. However, solving this problem exactly is NP-hard in general. To overcome the computational challenge, we introduce a submodular function maximization framework and devise a greedy algorithm with approximation guarantees. We derive a sufficient and necessary condition under which the rank-determination objective becomes submodular, and construct a closed-form projection of the Hessian matrix that satisfies this condition while maintaining computational efficiency. Our method combines solid theoretical foundations, second-order accuracy, and practical computational efficiency. We further extend SubLoRA to a joint optimization setting, alternating between LoRA parameter updates and rank determination under a rank budget constraint. Extensive experiments on fine-tuning physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that SubLoRA outperforms existing methods in both rank determination and joint training performance.",

Such systems often comprise sparsely activated experts combined under a single monolithic architecture and require a well-configured internal routing mechanism, which does not allow for selective low-level expert and router customization and requires additional training. We propose MoIRA, an architecture-agnostic modular MoE framework designed to coordinate existing experts with an external text-based router. MoIRA incorporates two zero-shot routing options: embedding-based similarity and prompt-driven language model inference. In our experiments, we choose large Vision-Language-Action models, gr00t-N1 and $\\pi_0$, as the underlying experts, and train low-rank adapters for low-overhead inference. We evaluate MoIRA on various GR1 Humanoid tasks and LIBERO Spatial and Goal benchmarks, where it consistently outperforms generalist models and competes with other MoE pipelines. Additionally, we analyse the robustness of the proposed approach to the variations of the instructions. While relying solely on textual descriptions of tasks and experts, MoIRA demonstrates the practical viability of modular deployment with precise, low-effort routing and provides an alternative, scalable foundation for future multi-expert robotic systems.",

Compared to existing Indian language evaluation tools, EKA-EVAL offers broader benchmark coverage, with built-in support for distributed inference, quantization, and multi-GPU usage. Our systematic comparison positions EKA-EVAL as the first end-to-end, extensible evaluation suite tailored for both global and Indic LLMs, significantly lowering the barrier to multilingual benchmarking. The framework is open-source and publicly available at https://github.com/lingo-iitgn/ eka-eval and a part of ongoing EKA initiative (https://eka.soket.ai), which aims to scale up to over 100 benchmarks and establish a robust, multilingual evaluation ecosystem for LLMs.",

      "abstract": "Dexterous teleoperation plays a crucial role in robotic manipulation for real-world data collection and remote robot control. Previous dexterous teleoperation mostly relies on hand retargeting to closely mimic human hand postures. However, these approaches may fail to fully leverage the inherent dexterity of dexterous hands, which can execute unique actions through their structural advantages compared to human hands. To address this limitation, we propose TypeTele, a type-guided dexterous teleoperation system, which enables dexterous hands to perform actions that are not constrained by human motion patterns. This is achieved by introducing dexterous manipulation types into the teleoperation system, allowing operators to employ appropriate types to complete specific tasks. To support this system, we build an extensible dexterous manipulation type library to cover comprehensive dexterous postures used in manipulation tasks. During teleoperation, we employ a MLLM (Multi-modality Large Language Model)-assisted type retrieval module to identify the most suitable manipulation type based on the specific task and operator commands. Extensive experiments of real-world teleoperation and imitation learning demonstrate that the incorporation of manipulation types significantly takes full advantage of the dexterous robot's ability to perform diverse and complex tasks with higher success rates.",

      "abstract": "Domain specific chatbot applications often involve multi step interactions, such as refining search filters, selecting multiple items, or performing comparisons. Traditional graphical user interfaces (GUIs) handle these workflows by providing explicit \"Submit\" (commit data) and \"Reset\" (discard data) actions, allowing back-end systems to track user intent unambiguously. In contrast, conversational agents rely on subtle language cues, which can lead to confusion and incomplete context management. This paper proposes modeling these GUI inspired metaphors acknowledgment (submit like) and context switching (reset-like) as explicit tasks within large language model (LLM) prompts. By capturing user acknowledgment, reset actions, and chain of thought (CoT) reasoning as structured session data, we preserve clarity, reduce user confusion, and align domain-specific chatbot interactions with back-end logic. We demonstrate our approach in hotel booking and customer management scenarios, highlighting improvements in multi-turn task coherence, user satisfaction, and efficiency.",

To address these limitations, we design Do-It-Yourself Multilingual Knowledge Graph (DIY-MKG), an open-source system that supports polyglot language learning. DIY-MKG allows the user to build personalized vocabulary knowledge graphs, which are constructed by selective expansion with related words suggested by an LLM. The system further enhances learning through rich annotation capabilities and an adaptive review module that leverages LLMs for dynamic, personalized quiz generation. In addition, DIY-MKG allows users to flag incorrect quiz questions, simultaneously increasing user engagement and providing a feedback loop for prompt refinement. Our evaluation of LLM-based components in DIY-MKG shows that vocabulary expansion is reliable and fair across multiple languages, and that the generated quizzes are highly accurate, validating the robustness of DIY-MKG.",

By foundation, we mean a model pretrained on massive amounts of time-series data which can learn complex temporal patterns useful for accurate modeling, forecasting, and detection of anomalies on previously unseen datasets. FAE leverages VAEs and Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to build a generic model for univariate time-series modeling, which could eventually perform properly in out-of-the-box, zero-shot anomaly detection applications. We introduce the main concepts of FAE, and present preliminary results in different multi-dimensional time-series datasets from various domains, including a real dataset from an operational mobile ISP, and the well known KDD 2021 Anomaly Detection dataset.",

However, its practical deployment faces considerable challenges, such as high computational complexity and the optimization of its complex processing. To address these challenges, this correspondence proposes a framework based on a sparse multi-dimensional graph neural network (SP-MDGNN), which sparsifies the connections between access points (APs) and user equipments (UEs) to significantly reduce computational complexity while maintaining high performance. In addition, the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm is introduced as a comparative method to further analyze the trade-off between performance and complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the sparse method achieves an optimal balance between performance and complexity, significantly reducing the computational complexity of the original MDGNN method while incurring only a slight performance degradation, providing insights for the practical deployment of CF mMIMO systems in large-scale network.",

Computing the bounded degree first integral, in general, is very expensive for a computer algebra system\\cite{duarte2021efficient}\\cite{cheze2020symbolic} and becomes impractical for ODE of large size. In \\cite{huang2025algorithm}, we have proposed an algorithm to find the inverse of a local rational transformation $y \\to \\frac{A(x,y)}{B(x,y)}$ that transforms a rational ODE to a simpler and more tractable structure $y^{\\prime}=\\sum_{i=0}^nf_i(x)y^i$, whose integrability under linear transformation $\\left\\{x \\to F(x),y \\to P(x)y+Q(x)\\right\\}$ can be detected by Maple efficiently \\cite{CHEBTERRAB2000204}\\cite{cheb2000first}. In that paper we have also mentioned when $M(x,y),N(x,y)$ of the reducible structure are not coprime, canceling the common factors in $y$ will alter the structure which makes that algorithm fail. In this paper, we consider this issue. We conclude that with the exact tight degree bound for the polynomial $A(x,y)$ given, we have an efficient algorithm to compute such transformation and the reduced ODE for \"quite a lot of\" cases where $M,N$ are not coprime.

Accessing Alps provides a significant computational advantage for researchers in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). While Alps serves a broad range of scientific communities, traditional HPC services alone are not sufficient to meet the dynamic needs of the ML community. This paper presents an initial investigation into extending HPC service capabilities to better support ML workloads. We identify key challenges and gaps we have observed since the early-access phase (2023) of Alps by the Swiss AI community and propose several technological enhancements. These include a user environment designed to facilitate the adoption of HPC for ML workloads, balancing performance with flexibility; a utility for rapid performance screening of ML applications during development; observability capabilities and data products for inspecting ongoing large-scale ML workloads; a utility to simplify the vetting of allocated nodes for compute readiness; a service plane infrastructure to deploy various types of workloads, including support and inference services; and a storage infrastructure tailored to the specific needs of ML workloads. These enhancements aim to facilitate the execution of ML workloads on HPC systems, increase system usability and resilience, and better align with the needs of the ML community. We also discuss our current approach to security aspects. This paper concludes by placing these proposals in the broader context of changes in the communities served by HPC infrastructure like ours.",

To address this challenge, we propose a dynamic temporal slot transformer (DTST) module that is trained both for temporal reasoning and for predicting the optimal future slot initialization. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple surgical databases, demonstrating that unsupervised object-centric methods can be applied to real-world data and become part of the common arsenal in healthcare applications.",

      "abstract": "Current lifelong person re-identification (LReID) methods predominantly rely on fully labeled data streams. However, in real-world scenarios where annotation resources are limited, a vast amount of unlabeled data coexists with scarce labeled samples, leading to the Semi-Supervised LReID (Semi-LReID) problem where LReID methods suffer severe performance degradation. Existing LReID methods, even when combined with semi-supervised strategies, suffer from limited long-term adaptation performance due to struggling with the noisy knowledge occurring during unlabeled data utilization. In this paper, we pioneer the investigation of Semi-LReID, introducing a novel Self-Reinforcing Prototype Evolution with Dual-Knowledge Cooperation framework (SPRED). Our key innovation lies in establishing a self-reinforcing cycle between dynamic prototype-guided pseudo-label generation and new-old knowledge collaborative purification to enhance the utilization of unlabeled data. Specifically, learnable identity prototypes are introduced to dynamically capture the identity distributions and generate high-quality pseudo-labels. Then, the dual-knowledge cooperation scheme integrates current model specialization and historical model generalization, refining noisy pseudo-labels. Through this cyclic design, reliable pseudo-labels are progressively mined to improve current-stage learning and ensure positive knowledge propagation over long-term learning. Experiments on the established Semi-LReID benchmarks show that our SPRED achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our source code is available at https://github.com/zhoujiahuan1991/ICCV2025-SPRED",

However, their substantial model size and high computational demands are impractical for widespread deployment. Yet, small language models (SLMs) often struggle to learn long-form CoT reasoning due to their limited capacity, a phenomenon we refer to as the \"SLMs Learnability Gap\". To address this, we introduce \\textbf{Mi}d-\\textbf{Co}T \\textbf{T}eacher \\textbf{A}ssistant Distillation (MiCoTAl), a framework for improving long CoT distillation for SLMs. MiCoTA employs intermediate-sized models as teacher assistants and utilizes intermediate-length CoT sequences to bridge both the capacity and reasoning length gaps. Our experiments on downstream tasks demonstrate that although SLMs distilled from large teachers can perform poorly, by applying MiCoTA, they achieve significant improvements in reasoning performance. Specifically, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct achieve an improvement of 3.47 and 3.93 respectively on average score on AIME2024, AMC, Olympiad, MATH-500 and GSM8K benchmarks. To better understand the mechanism behind MiCoTA, we perform a quantitative experiment demonstrating that our method produces data more closely aligned with base SLM distributions. Our insights pave the way for future research into long-CoT data distillation for SLMs.",

      "abstract": "Pruning is a highly effective approach for compressing large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing inference latency. However, conventional training-free structured pruning methods often employ a heuristic metric that indiscriminately removes some attention heads across all pruning layers, without considering their positions within the network architecture. In this work, we propose a novel pruning algorithm that strategically prunes attention heads in the model's higher layers. Since the removal of attention heads can alter the magnitude of token representations, we introduce an adaptive rescaling parameter that calibrates the representation scale post-pruning to counteract this effect. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a wide range of LLMs, including LLaMA3.1-8B, Mistral-7B-v0.3, Qwen2-7B, and Gemma2-9B. Our evaluation includes both generation and discriminative tasks across 27 datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that our method outperforms existing structured pruning methods. This improvement is particularly notable in generation tasks, where our approach significantly outperforms existing baselines.",

These AI technologies primarily aim to develop systems that can autonomously conduct research processes across a wide range of scientific disciplines. Despite these significant strides, a comprehensive survey on AI for Research (AI4Research) remains absent, which hampers our understanding and impedes further development in this field. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive survey and offer a unified perspective on AI4Research.

(2) New frontiers: Then, we identify key research gaps and highlight promising future directions, focusing on the rigor and scalability of automated experiments, as well as the societal impact. (3) Abundant applications and resources: Finally, we compile a wealth of resources, including relevant multidisciplinary applications, data corpora, and tools.

      "abstract": "Instruction-based image editing (IIE) has advanced rapidly with the success of diffusion models. However, existing efforts primarily focus on simple and explicit instructions to execute editing operations such as adding, deleting, moving, or swapping objects. They struggle to handle more complex implicit hypothetical instructions that require deeper reasoning to infer plausible visual changes and user intent. Additionally, current datasets provide limited support for training and evaluating reasoning-aware editing capabilities. Architecturally, these methods also lack mechanisms for fine-grained detail extraction that support such reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Reason50K, a large-scale dataset specifically curated for training and evaluating hypothetical instruction reasoning image editing, along with ReasonBrain, a novel framework designed to reason over and execute implicit hypothetical instructions across diverse scenarios. Reason50K includes over 50K samples spanning four key reasoning scenarios: Physical, Temporal, Causal, and Story reasoning. ReasonBrain leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for editing guidance generation and a diffusion model for image synthesis, incorporating a Fine-grained Reasoning Cue Extraction (FRCE) module to capture detailed visual and textual semantics essential for supporting instruction reasoning. To mitigate the semantic loss, we further introduce a Cross-Modal Enhancer (CME) that enables rich interactions between the fine-grained cues and MLLM-derived features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReasonBrain consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on reasoning scenarios while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization to conventional IIE tasks.

      "abstract": "Objective: Clinical implementation of deformable image registration (DIR) requires voxel-based spatial accuracy metrics such as manually identified landmarks, which are challenging to implement for highly mobile gastrointestinal (GI) organs. To address this, patient-specific digital twins (DT) modeling temporally varying motion were created to assess the accuracy of DIR methods. Approach: 21 motion phases simulating digestive GI motion as 4D sequences were generated from static 3D patient scans using published analytical GI motion models through a semi-automated pipeline. Eleven datasets, including six T2w FSE MRI (T2w MRI), two T1w 4D golden-angle stack-of-stars, and three contrast-enhanced CT scans. The motion amplitudes of the DTs were assessed against real patient stomach motion amplitudes extracted from independent 4D MRI datasets. The generated DTs were then used to assess six different DIR methods using target registration error, Dice similarity coefficient, and the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance using summary metrics and voxel-level granular visualizations. Finally, for a subset of T2w MRI scans from patients treated with MR-guided radiation therapy, dose distributions were warped and accumulated to assess dose warping errors, including evaluations of DIR performance in both low- and high-dose regions for patient-specific error estimation. Main results: Our proposed pipeline synthesized DTs modeling realistic GI motion, achieving mean and maximum motion amplitudes and a mean log Jacobian determinant within 0.8 mm and 0.01, respectively, similar to published real-patient gastric motion data. It also enables the extraction of detailed quantitative DIR performance metrics and rigorous validation of dose mapping accuracy. Significance: The pipeline enables rigorously testing DIR tools for dynamic, anatomically complex regions enabling granular spatial and dosimetric accuracies.",

      "abstract": "In orchard automation, dense foliage during the canopy season severely occludes tree structures, minimizing visibility to various canopy parts such as trunks and branches, which limits the ability of a machine vision system. However, canopy structure is more open and visible during the dormant season when trees are defoliated. In this work, we present an information fusion framework that integrates multi-seasonal structural data to support robotic and automated crop load management during the entire growing season. The framework combines high-resolution RGB-D imagery from both dormant and canopy periods using YOLOv9-Seg for instance segmentation, Kinect Fusion for 3D reconstruction, and Fast Generalized Iterative Closest Point (Fast GICP) for model alignment. Segmentation outputs from YOLOv9-Seg were used to extract depth-informed masks, which enabled accurate 3D point cloud reconstruction via Kinect Fusion; these reconstructed models from each season were subsequently aligned using Fast GICP to achieve spatially coherent multi-season fusion. The YOLOv9-Seg model, trained on manually annotated images, achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0047 and segmentation mAP@50 scores up to 0.78 for trunks in dormant season dataset. Kinect Fusion enabled accurate reconstruction of tree geometry, validated with field measurements resulting in root mean square errors (RMSE) of 5.23 mm for trunk diameter, 4.50 mm for branch diameter, and 13.72 mm for branch spacing. Fast GICP achieved precise cross-seasonal registration with a minimum fitness score of 0.00197, allowing integrated, comprehensive tree structure modeling despite heavy occlusions during the growing season. This fused structural representation enables robotic systems to access otherwise obscured architectural information, improving the precision of pruning, thinning, and other automated orchard operations.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a powerful technique for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, effectively aligning LLMs with diverse human preferences remains a significant challenge, particularly when they are conflict. To address this issue, we frame human value alignment as a multi-objective optimization problem, aiming to maximize a set of potentially conflicting objectives. We introduce Gradient-Adaptive Policy Optimization (GAPO), a novel fine-tuning paradigm that employs multiple-gradient descent to align LLMs with diverse preference distributions. GAPO adaptively rescales the gradients for each objective to determine an update direction that optimally balances the trade-offs between objectives. Additionally, we introduce P-GAPO, which incorporates user preferences across different objectives and achieves Pareto solutions that better align with the user's specific needs. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that GAPO converges towards a Pareto optimal solution for multiple objectives. Empirical results on Mistral-7B show that GAPO outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both helpfulness and harmlessness.",

      "abstract": "We present a novel framework for PDE-constrained $r$-adaptivity of high-order meshes. The proposed method formulates mesh movement as an optimization problem, with an objective function defined as a convex combination of a mesh quality metric and a measure of the accuracy of the PDE solution obtained via finite element discretization. The proposed formulation achieves optimized, well-defined high-order meshes by integrating mesh quality control, PDE solution accuracy, and robust gradient regularization. We adopt the Target-Matrix Optimization Paradigm to control geometric properties across the mesh, independent of the PDE of interest. To incorporate the accuracy of the PDE solution, we introduce error measures that control the finite element discretization error. The implicit dependence of these error measures on the mesh nodal positions is accurately captured by adjoint sensitivity analysis. Additionally, a convolution-based gradient regularization strategy is used to ensure stable and effective adaptation of high-order meshes. We demonstrate that the proposed framework can improve mesh quality and reduce the error by up to 10 times for the solution of Poisson and linear elasto-static problems. The approach is general with respect to the dimensionality, the order of the mesh, the types of mesh elements, and can be applied to any PDE that admits well-defined adjoint operators.",

However, there has not been a systematic study of what kind of reasoning demonstrations from the teacher are most effective in improving the student model's reasoning capabilities. In this work we curate high-quality \"NaturalThoughts\" by selecting reasoning traces from a strong teacher model based on a large pool of questions from NaturalReasoning (Yuan et al. 2025). We first conduct a systematic analysis of factors that affect distilling reasoning capabilities, in terms of sample efficiency and scalability for general reasoning tasks. We observe that simply scaling up data size with random sampling is a strong baseline with steady performance gains. Further, we find that selecting difficult examples that require more diverse reasoning strategies is more sample-efficient to transfer the teacher model's reasoning skills. Evaluated on both Llama and Qwen models, training with NaturalThoughts outperforms existing reasoning datasets such as OpenThoughts, LIMO, etc. on general STEM reasoning benchmarks including GPQA-Diamond, MMLU-Pro and SuperGPQA.",

We propose a decision-oriented framework for evaluating generated text by directly measuring its influence on human and large language model (LLM) decision outcomes. Using market digest texts--including objective morning summaries and subjective closing-bell analyses--as test cases, we assess decision quality based on the financial performance of trades executed by human investors and autonomous LLM agents informed exclusively by these texts. Our findings reveal that neither humans nor LLM agents consistently surpass random performance when relying solely on summaries. However, richer analytical commentaries enable collaborative human-LLM teams to outperform individual human or agent baselines significantly. Our approach underscores the importance of evaluating generated text by its ability to facilitate synergistic decision-making between humans and LLMs, highlighting critical limitations of traditional intrinsic metrics.",

Prior work has not evaluated such hybrid models trained on pseudo-labeled data in the context of healthcare billing. The approach is evaluated on two real-world billing datasets related to mental healthcare. The iForest LSTM baseline achieves the highest recall (0.963) on declaration-level data. On the operation-level data, the hybrid iForest-based model achieves the highest recall (0.744), though at the cost of lower precision.

Despite seemingly diverse approaches, we observe that current VLA models can be unified under a single framework: vision and language inputs are processed by a series of VLA modules, producing a chain of \\textit{action tokens} that progressively encode more grounded and actionable information, ultimately generating executable actions. We further determine that the primary design choice distinguishing VLA models lies in how action tokens are formulated, which can be categorized into language description, code, affordance, trajectory, goal state, latent representation, raw action, and reasoning. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding action tokens, significantly impeding effective VLA development and obscuring future directions. Therefore, this survey aims to categorize and interpret existing VLA research through the lens of action tokenization, distill the strengths and limitations of each token type, and identify areas for improvement. Through this systematic review and analysis, we offer a synthesized outlook on the broader evolution of VLA models, highlight underexplored yet promising directions, and contribute guidance for future research, hoping to bring the field closer to general-purpose intelligence.",

      "abstract": "Image customization, a crucial technique for industrial media production, aims to generate content that is consistent with reference images. However, current approaches conventionally separate image customization into position-aware and position-free customization paradigms and lack a universal framework for diverse customization, limiting their applications across various scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IC-Custom, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates position-aware and position-free image customization through in-context learning. IC-Custom concatenates reference images with target images to a polyptych, leveraging DiT's multi-modal attention mechanism for fine-grained token-level interactions. We introduce the In-context Multi-Modal Attention (ICMA) mechanism with learnable task-oriented register tokens and boundary-aware positional embeddings to enable the model to correctly handle different task types and distinguish various inputs in polyptych configurations. To bridge the data gap, we carefully curated a high-quality dataset of 12k identity-consistent samples with 8k from real-world sources and 4k from high-quality synthetic data, avoiding the overly glossy and over-saturated synthetic appearance. IC-Custom supports various industrial applications, including try-on, accessory placement, furniture arrangement, and creative IP customization. Extensive evaluations on our proposed ProductBench and the publicly available DreamBench demonstrate that IC-Custom significantly outperforms community workflows, closed-source models, and state-of-the-art open-source approaches. IC-Custom achieves approximately 73% higher human preference across identity consistency, harmonicity, and text alignment metrics, while training only 0.4% of the original model parameters.

In recent years, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become increasingly popular. In addition, exploring applications of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) has provided new perspectives for research into vision model architectures. In this paper, we present evMLP accompanied by a simple event-driven local update mechanism. The proposed evMLP can independently process patches on images or feature maps via MLPs. We define changes between consecutive frames as \"events\". Under the event-driven local update mechanism, evMLP selectively processes patches where events occur. For sequential image data (e.g., video processing), this approach improves computational performance by avoiding redundant computations. Through ImageNet image classification experiments, evMLP attains accuracy competitive with state-of-the-art models. More significantly, experimental results on multiple video datasets demonstrate that evMLP reduces computational cost via its event-driven local update mechanism while maintaining output consistency with its non-event-driven baseline.

Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of LLMs for translating human instructions into executable control code for UAV operations. However, LLMs still face challenges from logical reasoning and complex decision-making, leading to concerns about the reliability of LLM-driven UAV operations. In this paper, we propose a LLM-driven closed-loop control framework that enables reliable UAV operations powered by effective feedback and refinement using two LLM modules, i.e., a Code Generator and an Evaluator. Our framework transforms numerical state observations from UAV operations into natural language trajectory descriptions to enhance the evaluator LLM's understanding of UAV dynamics for precise feedback generation. Our framework also enables a simulation-based refinement process, and hence eliminates the risks to physical UAVs caused by incorrect code execution during the refinement. Extensive experiments on UAV control tasks with different complexities are conducted. The experimental results show that our framework can achieve reliable UAV operations using LLMs, which significantly outperforms baseline approaches in terms of success rate and completeness with the increase of task complexity.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, neural models trained on large multilingual text and speech datasets have shown great potential for supporting low-resource languages. This study investigates the performances of two state-of-the-art Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models, OpenAI's Whisper (Small & Large-V2) and Facebook's Wav2Vec-BERT on Bangla, a low-resource language. We have conducted experiments using two publicly available datasets: Mozilla Common Voice-17 and OpenSLR to evaluate model performances. Through systematic fine-tuning and hyperparameter optimization, including learning rate, epochs, and model checkpoint selection, we have compared the models based on Word Error Rate (WER), Character Error Rate (CER), Training Time, and Computational Efficiency. The Wav2Vec-BERT model outperformed Whisper across all key evaluation metrics, demonstrated superior performance while requiring fewer computational resources, and offered valuable insights to develop robust speech recognition systems in low-resource linguistic settings.",

They are being fast deployed as chatbots and evaluators in sensitive areas, such as peer review and mental health applications. This, along with the disparate accounts on their reasoning capabilities, calls for a closer examination of LLMs and their comprehension of dialogue. In this work we begin by evaluating LLMs' ability to maintain a debate--one of the purest yet most complex forms of human communication. Then we measure how this capability relates to their understanding of what is being talked about, namely, their comprehension of dialogical structures and the pragmatic context. We find that LLMs are capable of maintaining coherent, persuasive debates, often swaying the beliefs of participants and audiences alike. We also note that awareness or suspicion of AI involvement encourage people to be more critical of the arguments made. When polling LLMs on their comprehension of deeper structures of dialogue, however, they cannot demonstrate said understanding. Our findings tie the shortcomings of LLMs-as-evaluators to their (in)ability to understand the context. More broadly, for the field of argumentation theory we posit that, if an agent can convincingly maintain a dialogue, it is not necessary for it to know what it is talking about. Hence, the modelling of pragmatic context and coherence are secondary to effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Text-to-video (T2V) generation has recently attracted considerable attention, resulting in the development of numerous high-quality datasets that have propelled progress in this area. However, existing public datasets are primarily composed of isolated text-video (T-V) pairs and thus fail to support the modeling of coherent multi-clip video sequences. To address this limitation, we introduce CI-VID, a dataset that moves beyond isolated text-to-video (T2V) generation toward text-and-video-to-video (TV2V) generation, enabling models to produce coherent, multi-scene video sequences. CI-VID contains over 340,000 samples, each featuring a coherent sequence of video clips with text captions that capture both the individual content of each clip and the transitions between them, enabling visually and textually grounded generation. To further validate the effectiveness of CI-VID, we design a comprehensive, multi-dimensional benchmark incorporating human evaluation, VLM-based assessment, and similarity-based metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained on CI-VID exhibit significant improvements in both accuracy and content consistency when generating video sequences. This facilitates the creation of story-driven content with smooth visual transitions and strong temporal coherence, underscoring the quality and practical utility of the CI-VID dataset We release the CI-VID dataset and the accompanying code for data construction and evaluation at: https://github.com/ymju-BAAI/CI-VID",

      "abstract": "Animation colorization is a crucial part of real animation industry production. Long animation colorization has high labor costs. Therefore, automated long animation colorization based on the video generation model has significant research value. Existing studies are limited to short-term colorization. These studies adopt a local paradigm, fusing overlapping features to achieve smooth transitions between local segments. However, the local paradigm neglects global information, failing to maintain long-term color consistency. In this study, we argue that ideal long-term color consistency can be achieved through a dynamic global-local paradigm, i.e., dynamically extracting global color-consistent features relevant to the current generation. Specifically, we propose LongAnimation, a novel framework, which mainly includes a SketchDiT, a Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and a Color Consistency Reward. The SketchDiT captures hybrid reference features to support the DGLM module. The DGLM module employs a long video understanding model to dynamically compress global historical features and adaptively fuse them with the current generation features. To refine the color consistency, we introduce a Color Consistency Reward. During inference, we propose a color consistency fusion to smooth the video segment transition. Extensive experiments on both short-term (14 frames) and long-term (average 500 frames) animations show the effectiveness of LongAnimation in maintaining short-term and long-term color consistency for open-domain animation colorization task.

      "abstract": "While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on static images, they often fall short in comprehending dynamic, information-dense short-form videos, a dominant medium in today's digital landscape. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{Kwai Keye-VL}, an 8-billion-parameter multimodal foundation model engineered for leading-edge performance in short-video understanding while maintaining robust general-purpose vision-language abilities. The development of Keye-VL rests on two core pillars: a massive, high-quality dataset exceeding 600 billion tokens with a strong emphasis on video, and an innovative training recipe. This recipe features a four-stage pre-training process for solid vision-language alignment, followed by a meticulous two-phase post-training process. The first post-training stage enhances foundational capabilities like instruction following, while the second phase focuses on stimulating advanced reasoning. In this second phase, a key innovation is our five-mode ``cold-start'' data mixture, which includes ``thinking'', ``non-thinking'', ``auto-think'', ``think with image'', and high-quality video data. This mixture teaches the model to decide when and how to reason. Subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) and alignment steps further enhance these reasoning capabilities and correct abnormal model behaviors, such as repetitive outputs. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive evaluations, showing that Keye-VL achieves state-of-the-art results on public video benchmarks and remains highly competitive on general image-based tasks (Figure 1). Furthermore, we develop and release the \\textbf{KC-MMBench}, a new benchmark tailored for real-world short-video scenarios, where Keye-VL shows a significant advantage.",

Through sharing the backbone network and using task-specific heads for next token prediction and process scoring respectively, SPRM successfully integrates the policy model and process reward model(PRM) into a unified interface without extra process annotation, reducing over 99% PRM parameters for efficient reasoning. Equipped with SPRM, MetaStone-S1 is naturally suitable for test time scaling (TTS), and we provide three reasoning effort modes (low, medium, and high), based on the controllable thinking length. Moreover, we empirically establish a scaling law that reveals the relationship between total thinking computation and TTS performance. Experiments demonstrate that our MetaStone-S1 achieves comparable performance to OpenAI-o3-mini's series with only 32B parameter size.

Despite their efficiency and potential, tuning-free methods face challenges in maintaining high-quality results due to the non-linear nature of the multi-step denoising process and biases inherited from the pre-trained diffusion model. In this paper, we introduce FreeMorph to address these challenges by integrating two key innovations. 1) We first propose a guidance-aware spherical interpolation design that incorporates explicit guidance from the input images by modifying the self-attention modules, thereby addressing identity loss and ensuring directional transitions throughout the generated sequence. 2) We further introduce a step-oriented variation trend that blends self-attention modules derived from each input image to achieve controlled and consistent transitions that respect both inputs. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that FreeMorph outperforms existing methods, being 10x ~ 50x faster and establishing a new state-of-the-art for image morphing.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4o, have recently made remarkable progress, but it is not clear where exactly these models stand in terms of understanding vision. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular multimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0 Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and surface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and its variants, etc).\n  The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to output text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or 3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at an API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these challenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable and API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized benchmarking framework.\n  We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art specialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists; this is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based tasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4) While the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit less sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among non-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6) reasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a preliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest GPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial misalignments.",

Traditional autoregressive image generation relies on next-patch prediction, a memory-bound process that leads to high latency. Existing works have tried to parallelize next-patch prediction by shifting to multi-patch prediction to accelerate the process, but only achieved limited parallelization. To achieve high parallelization while maintaining generation quality, we introduce two key techniques: (1) Flexible Parallelized Autoregressive Modeling, a novel architecture that enables arbitrary generation ordering and degrees of parallelization. It uses learnable position query tokens to guide generation at target positions while ensuring mutual visibility among concurrently generated tokens for consistent parallel decoding. (2) Locality-aware Generation Ordering, a novel schedule that forms groups to minimize intra-group dependencies and maximize contextual support, enhancing generation quality. With these designs, we reduce the generation steps from 256 to 20 (256$\\times$256 res.) and 1024 to 48 (512$\\times$512 res.) without compromising quality on the ImageNet class-conditional generation, and achieving at least 3.4$\\times$ lower latency than previous parallelized autoregressive models.",

These enable efficient, scalable iterative solvers with robustness across a wide range of viscosities.

      "abstract": "Recently, mobile manipulation has attracted increasing attention for enabling language-conditioned robotic control in household tasks. However, existing methods still face challenges in coordinating mobile base and manipulator, primarily due to two limitations. On the one hand, they fail to explicitly model the influence of the mobile base on manipulator control, which easily leads to error accumulation under high degrees of freedom. On the other hand, they treat the entire mobile manipulation process with the same visual observation modality (e.g., either all 2D or all 3D), overlooking the distinct multimodal perception requirements at different stages during mobile manipulation. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Coordination Diffusion Transformer (AC-DiT), which enhances mobile base and manipulator coordination for end-to-end mobile manipulation. First, since the motion of the mobile base directly influences the manipulator's actions, we introduce a mobility-to-body conditioning mechanism that guides the model to first extract base motion representations, which are then used as context prior for predicting whole-body actions. This enables whole-body control that accounts for the potential impact of the mobile base's motion. Second, to meet the perception requirements at different stages of mobile manipulation, we design a perception-aware multimodal conditioning strategy that dynamically adjusts the fusion weights between various 2D visual images and 3D point clouds, yielding visual features tailored to the current perceptual needs. This allows the model to, for example, adaptively rely more on 2D inputs when semantic information is crucial for action prediction, while placing greater emphasis on 3D geometric information when precise spatial understanding is required. We validate AC-DiT through extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world mobile manipulation tasks.",

In addition, the other well-known numerical artefact, dispersion error (artificial oscillations emerging at sharp changes), should also be minimal to avoid confusion with the true wavy behaviour. The continuum thermodynamical aspects (respect for balances with fluxes, systematic constitutive relationships between intensive quantities and fluxes, the second law of thermodynamics with positive definite entropy production, and the spacetime-based kinematic viewpoint) prove valuable for obtaining such extended schemes and for monitoring the solutions. Generalizing earlier works in this direction, here, we establish and investigate such a numerical scheme for one-dimensional viscoelastic wave propagation in the presence of heat conduction coupled via thermal expansion, demonstrating long-term reliability and the applicability of thermodynamics-based quantities in supervising the quality of the solution.",

Despite significant progress in this field, current multi-organ segmentation models often suffer from inaccurate details, dependence on geometric prompts and loss of spatial information. Addressing these challenges, we introduce a novel model named CRISP-SAM2 with CRoss-modal Interaction and Semantic Prompting based on SAM2. This model represents a promising approach to multi-organ medical segmentation guided by textual descriptions of organs. Our method begins by converting visual and textual inputs into cross-modal contextualized semantics using a progressive cross-attention interaction mechanism. These semantics are then injected into the image encoder to enhance the detailed understanding of visual information. To eliminate reliance on geometric prompts, we use a semantic prompting strategy, replacing the original prompt encoder to sharpen the perception of challenging targets. In addition, a similarity-sorting self-updating strategy for memory and a mask-refining process is applied to further adapt to medical imaging and enhance localized details. Comparative experiments conducted on seven public datasets indicate that CRISP-SAM2 outperforms existing models. Extensive analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, thereby confirming its superior performance, especially in addressing the limitations mentioned earlier.

The evaluation framework combines technical insights with practical experimentation through criteria specifically designed to investigate the practical and creative affordances of the systems within the iterative, non-linear nature of music production. Employing a single-evaluator methodology as a preliminary phase, this research adopts a mixed approach utilizing qualitative methods to form hypotheses subsequently assessed through quantitative metrics. The selected systems represent architectural diversity across both symbolic and audio-based music generation approaches, spanning composition, arrangement, and sound design tasks. The investigation addresses limitations of current MGS in music production, challenges and opportunities for workflow integration, and development potential as collaborative tools while maintaining artistic authenticity. Findings reveal these systems function primarily as complementary tools enhancing rather than replacing human expertise. They exhibit limitations in maintaining thematic and structural coherence that emphasize the indispensable role of human creativity in tasks demanding emotional depth and complex decision-making. This study contributes a structured evaluation framework that considers the iterative nature of music creation. It identifies methodological refinements necessary for subsequent comprehensive evaluations and determines viable areas for AI integration as collaborative tools in creative workflows. The research provides empirically-grounded insights to guide future development in the field.",

The model was built off a custom speech command corpus made up of general directives, numbers, and a wake word.

      "abstract": "Deep learning offers transformative potential in medical imaging, yet its clinical adoption is frequently hampered by challenges such as data scarcity, distribution shifts, and the need for robust task generalization. Prompt-based methodologies have emerged as a pivotal strategy to guide deep learning models, providing flexible, domain-specific adaptations that significantly enhance model performance and adaptability without extensive retraining. This systematic review critically examines the burgeoning landscape of prompt engineering in medical imaging. We dissect diverse prompt modalities, including textual instructions, visual prompts, and learnable embeddings, and analyze their integration for core tasks such as image generation, segmentation, and classification. Our synthesis reveals how these mechanisms improve task-specific outcomes by enhancing accuracy, robustness, and data efficiency and reducing reliance on manual feature engineering while fostering greater model interpretability by making the model's guidance explicit. Despite substantial advancements, we identify persistent challenges, particularly in prompt design optimization, data heterogeneity, and ensuring scalability for clinical deployment. Finally, this review outlines promising future trajectories, including advanced multimodal prompting and robust clinical integration, underscoring the critical role of prompt-driven AI in accelerating the revolution of diagnostics and personalized treatment planning in medicine.",

      "abstract": "Signal detection is one of the main challenges of data science. According to the nature of the data, the presence of noise may corrupt measurements and hinder the discovery of significant patterns. A wide range of techniques aiming at extracting the relevant degrees of freedom from data has been thus developed over the years. However, signal detection in almost continuous spectra, for small signal-to-noise ratios, remains a known difficult issue. This paper develops over recent advancements proposing to tackle this issue by analysing the properties of the underlying effective field theory arising as a sort of maximal entropy distribution in the vicinity of universal random matrix distributions. Nearly continuous spectra provide an intrinsic and non-conventional scaling law for field and couplings, the scaling dimensions depending on the energy scale. The coarse-graining over small eigenvalues of the empirical spectrum defines a specific renormalization group, whose characteristics change when the collective behaviour of \"informational\" modes become significant, that is, stronger than the intrinsic fluctuations of noise. This paper pursues three different goals. First, we propose to quantify the real effects of fluctuations relative to what can be called \"signal\", while improving the robustness of the results obtained in our previous work. Second, we show that quantitative changes in the presence of a signal result in a counterintuitive modification of the distribution of eigenvectors. Finally, we propose a method for estimating the number of noise components and define a limit of detection in a general nearly continuous spectrum using the renormalization group. The main statements of this paper are essentially numeric, and their reproducibility can be checked using the associated code.",

Quantum networks will become the backbone of hybrid, quantum-augmented data centers, in which quantum algorithms are distributed over a local network of quantum processing units (QPUs) interconnected via shared entanglement. In this context, it is crucial to develop methods and software that minimize the number of inter-QPU communications. Here we describe key features of the quantum compiler araQne, which is designed to minimize distribution cost, measured by the number of entangled pairs required to distribute a monolithic quantum circuit using gate teleportation protocols. We establish the crucial role played by circuit reordering strategies, which strongly reduce the distribution cost compared to a baseline approach.",

      "abstract": "Time-varying group interactions constitute the building blocks of many complex systems. The framework of temporal hypergraphs makes it possible to represent them by taking into account the higher-order and temporal nature of the interactions. However, the corresponding datasets are often incomplete and/or limited in size and duration, and surrogate time-varying hypergraphs able to reproduce their statistical features constitute interesting substitutions, especially to understand how dynamical processes unfold on group interactions. Here, we present a new temporal hypergraph model, the Emerging Activity Temporal Hypergraph (EATH), which can be fed by parameters measured in a dataset and create synthetic datasets with similar properties. In the model, each node has an independent underlying activity dynamic and the overall system activity emerges from the nodes dynamics, with temporal group interactions resulting from both the activity of the nodes and memory mechanisms. We first show that the EATH model can generate surrogate hypergraphs of several empirical datasets of face-to-face interactions, mimicking temporal and topological properties at the node and hyperedge level. We also showcase the possibility to use the resulting synthetic data in simulations of higher-order contagion dynamics, comparing the outcome of such process on original and surrogate datasets. Finally, we illustrate the flexibility of the model, which can generate synthetic hypergraphs with tunable properties: as an example, we generate \"hybrid\" temporal hypergraphs, which mix properties of different empirical datasets. Our work opens several perspectives, from the generation of synthetic realistic hypergraphs describing contexts where data collection is difficult to a deeper understanding of dynamical processes on temporal hypergraphs.",

The common wisdom is that each circuit should be transpiled using up-to-date noise calibration data to optimize fidelity. In this work, we revisit the necessity of frequent noise-adaptive transpilation, conducting an in-depth empirical study across five IBM 127-qubit quantum computers and 16 diverse quantum algorithms. Our findings reveal novel and interesting insights: (1) noise-aware transpilation leads to a heavy concentration of workloads on a small subset of qubits, which increases output error variability; (2) using random mapping can mitigate this effect while maintaining comparable average fidelity; and (3) circuits compiled once with calibration data can be reliably reused across multiple calibration cycles and time periods without significant loss in fidelity. These results suggest that the classical overhead associated with daily, per-circuit noise-aware transpilation may not be justified. We propose lightweight alternatives that reduce this overhead without sacrificing fidelity -- offering a path to more efficient and scalable quantum workflows.",

This hypothesis leads to a new paradigm for image compression by encoding image statistics into the network substructure. Building on this hypothesis, we propose LotteryCodec, which overfits a binary mask to an individual image, leveraging an over-parameterized and randomly initialized network shared by the encoder and the decoder. To address over-parameterization challenges and streamline subnetwork search, we develop a rewind modulation mechanism that improves the RD performance. LotteryCodec outperforms VTM and sets a new state-of-the-art in single-image compression. LotteryCodec also enables adaptive decoding complexity through adjustable mask ratios, offering flexible compression solutions for diverse device constraints and application requirements.",

      "abstract": "Extremely large aperture array operating in the near-field regime unlocks additional spatial resources that can be exploited to simultaneously serve multiple users even when they share the same angular direction, a capability not achievable in conventional far-field systems. A fundamental question, however, remains: What is the maximum spatial degree of freedom (DoF) of spatial multiplexing in the distance domain?\n  In this paper, we address this open problem by investigating the spatial DoF of a line-of-sight (LoS) channel between a large two-dimensional transmit aperture and a linear receive array with collinearly-aligned elements (i.e., at the same angular direction) but located at different distances from the transmit aperture. We assume that both the aperture and linear array are continuous-aperture (CAP) arrays with an infinite number of elements and infinitesimal spacing, which establishes an upper bound for the spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) in the case of finite elements. First, we assume an ideal case where the transmit array is a single piece and the linear array is on the broad side of the transmit array. By reformulating the channel as an integral operator with a Hermitian convolution kernel, we derive a closed-form expression for the spatial DoF via the Fourier transform. Our analysis shows that the spatial DoF in the distance domain is predominantly determined by the extreme boundaries of the array rather than its detailed interior structure. We further extend the framework to non-broadside configurations by employing a projection method, which effectively converts the spatial DoF to an equivalent broadside case. Finally, we extend our analytical framework to the modular array, which shows the spatial DoF gain over the single-piece array given the constraint of the physical length of the array.",

      "abstract": "Precisely classifying earthquake types is crucial for elucidating the relationship between volcanic earthquakes and volcanic activity. However, traditional methods rely on subjective human judgment, which requires considerable time and effort. To address this issue, we developed a deep learning model using a transformer encoder for a more objective and efficient classification. Tested on Mount Asama's diverse seismic activity, our model achieved high F1 scores (0.930 for volcano tectonic, 0.931 for low-frequency earthquakes, and 0.980 for noise), superior to a conventional CNN-based method. To enhance interpretability, attention weight visualizations were analyzed, revealing that the model focuses on key waveform features similarly to human experts. However, inconsistencies in training data, such as ambiguously labeled B-type events with S-waves, were found to influence classification accuracy and attention weight distributions. Experiments addressing data selection and augmentation demonstrated the importance of balancing data quality and diversity. In addition, stations within 3 km of the crater played an important role in improving model performance and interpretability. These findings highlight the potential of Transformer-based models for automated volcanic earthquake classification, particularly in improving efficiency and interpretability. By addressing challenges such as data imbalance and subjective labeling, our approach provides a robust framework for understanding seismic activity at Mount Asama. Moreover, this framework offers opportunities for transfer learning to other volcanic regions, paving the way for enhanced volcanic hazard assessments and disaster mitigation strategies.",

      "abstract": "The use of deep learning (DL) in medical image analysis has significantly improved the ability to predict lung cancer. In this study, we introduce a novel deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model, named ResNet+, which is based on the established ResNet framework. This model is specifically designed to improve the prediction of lung cancer and diseases using the images. To address the challenge of missing feature information that occurs during the downsampling process in CNNs, we integrate the ResNet-D module, a variant designed to enhance feature extraction capabilities by modifying the downsampling layers, into the traditional ResNet model. Furthermore, a convolutional attention module was incorporated into the bottleneck layers to enhance model generalization by allowing the network to focus on relevant regions of the input images. We evaluated the proposed model using five public datasets, comprising lung cancer (LC2500 $n$=3183, IQ-OTH/NCCD $n$=1336, and LCC $n$=25000 images) and lung disease (ChestXray $n$=5856, and COVIDx-CT $n$=425024 images). To address class imbalance, we used data augmentation techniques to artificially increase the representation of underrepresented classes in the training dataset. The experimental results show that ResNet+ model demonstrated remarkable accuracy/F1, reaching 98.14/98.14\\% on the LC25000 dataset and 99.25/99.13\\% on the IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset. Furthermore, the ResNet+ model saved computational cost compared to the original ResNet series in predicting lung cancer images. The proposed model outperformed the baseline models on publicly available datasets, achieving better performance metrics.

      "abstract": "The existence of one-way functions (OWFs) forms the minimal assumption in classical cryptography. However, this is not necessarily the case in quantum cryptography. One-way puzzles (OWPuzzs), introduced by Khurana and Tomer, provide a natural quantum analogue of OWFs. The existence of OWPuzzs implies $PP\\neq BQP$, while the converse remains open. In classical cryptography, the analogous problem-whether OWFs can be constructed from $P \\neq NP$-has long been studied from the viewpoint of hardness of learning. Hardness of learning in various frameworks (including PAC learning) has been connected to OWFs or to $P \\neq NP$. In contrast, no such characterization previously existed for OWPuzzs. In this paper, we establish the first complete characterization of OWPuzzs based on the hardness of a well-studied learning model: distribution learning. Specifically, we prove that OWPuzzs exist if and only if proper quantum distribution learning is hard on average. A natural question that follows is whether the worst-case hardness of proper quantum distribution learning can be derived from $PP \\neq BQP$. If so, and a worst-case to average-case hardness reduction is achieved, it would imply OWPuzzs solely from $PP \\neq BQP$. However, we show that this would be extremely difficult: if worst-case hardness is PP-hard (in a black-box reduction), then $SampBQP \\neq SampBPP$ follows from the infiniteness of the polynomial hierarchy. Despite that, we show that $PP \\neq BQP$ is equivalent to another standard notion of hardness of learning: agnostic. We prove that $PP \\neq BQP$ if and only if agnostic quantum distribution learning with respect to KL divergence is hard. As a byproduct, we show that hardness of agnostic quantum distribution learning with respect to statistical distance against $PPT^{\\Sigma_3^P}$ learners implies $SampBQP \\neq SampBPP$.",

However, the segmented vascular structure is often discontinuous due to its slender nature and inadequate prior modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel Serpentine Window Mamba (SWinMamba) to achieve accurate vascular segmentation. The proposed SWinMamba innovatively models the continuity of slender vascular structures by incorporating serpentine window sequences into bidirectional state space models. The serpentine window sequences enable efficient feature capturing by adaptively guiding global visual context modeling to the vascular structure. Specifically, the Serpentine Window Tokenizer (SWToken) adaptively splits the input image using overlapping serpentine window sequences, enabling flexible receptive fields (RFs) for vascular structure modeling. The Bidirectional Aggregation Module (BAM) integrates coherent local features in the RFs for vascular continuity representation. In addition, dual-domain learning with Spatial-Frequency Fusion Unit (SFFU) is designed to enhance the feature representation of vascular structure. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that the proposed SWinMamba achieves superior performance with complete and connected vessels.",

      "abstract": "MR imaging techniques are of great benefit to disease diagnosis. However, due to the limitation of MR devices, significant intensity inhomogeneity often exists in imaging results, which impedes both qualitative and quantitative medical analysis. Recently, several unsupervised deep learning-based models have been proposed for MR image improvement. However, these models merely concentrate on global appearance learning, and neglect constraints from image structures and smoothness of bias field, leading to distorted corrected results. In this paper, novel structure and smoothness constrained dual networks, named S2DNets, are proposed aiming to self-supervised bias field correction. S2DNets introduce piece-wise structural constraints and smoothness of bias field for network training to effectively remove non-uniform intensity and retain much more structural details. Extensive experiments executed on both clinical and simulated MR datasets show that the proposed model outperforms other conventional and deep learning-based models. In addition to comparison on visual metrics, downstream MR image segmentation tasks are also used to evaluate the impact of the proposed model.

This novel architecture generates tokens with a unique \"locality\" property, as validated by experiments demonstrating optimal trade-offs among content faithfulness, temporal coherence, and structural recoverability. Then, to address data scarcity for the FAC module, we adopted a multitask learning strategy that jointly trains the FAC and TTS modules. Beyond mitigating data limitations, this approach yielded accelerated convergence and superior speech quality compared to standalone FAC training. Moreover, leveraging the salient properties of our discrete speech representations, we introduce SpeechRestorer, a postprocessing architecture designed to refine LLM-generated outputs. This module effectively mitigates stochastic errors prevalent in LLM inference pipelines while enhancing prosodic continuity, as validated by ablation experiments.",

      "abstract": "Japanese idol groups, comprising performers known as \"idols,\" are an indispensable part of Japanese pop culture. They frequently appear in live concerts and television programs, entertaining audiences with their singing and dancing. Similar to other J-pop songs, idol group music covers a wide range of styles, with various types of chord progressions and instrumental arrangements. These tracks often feature numerous instruments and employ complex mastering techniques, resulting in high signal loudness. Additionally, most songs include a song division (utawari) structure, in which members alternate between singing solos and performing together. Hence, these songs are well-suited for benchmarking various music information processing techniques such as singer diarization, music source separation, and automatic chord estimation under challenging conditions. Focusing on these characteristics, we constructed a song corpus titled IdolSongsJp by commissioning professional composers to create 15 tracks in the style of Japanese idol groups. This corpus includes not only mastered audio tracks but also stems for music source separation, dry vocal tracks, and chord annotations. This paper provides a detailed description of the corpus, demonstrates its diversity through comparisons with real-world idol group songs, and presents its application in evaluating several music information processing techniques.",

A system that provides reference likable voice samples tailored to target audiences would enable users to adjust their speaking style and voice quality, facilitating smoother communication. To this end, we propose a voice conversion method that controls the likability of input speech while preserving both speaker identity and linguistic content. To improve training data scalability, we train a likability predictor on an existing voice likability dataset and employ it to automatically annotate a large speech synthesis corpus with likability ratings. Experimental evaluations reveal a significant correlation between the predictor's outputs and human-provided likability ratings. Subjective and objective evaluations further demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively controls voice likability while preserving both speaker identity and linguistic content.",

Second, we obtain a sharp binary variant of the Beckner-Hirschman entropic uncertainty principle, as well as a sharp lower estimate on the entropy of a sum of two independent random variables with values in $\\{0,1\\}^d$.

      "abstract": "The limited availability of bronchoscopy images makes image synthesis particularly interesting for training deep learning models. Robust image translation across different domains -- virtual bronchoscopy, phantom as well as in-vivo and ex-vivo image data -- is pivotal for clinical applications. This paper proposes BronchoGAN introducing anatomical constraints for image-to-image translation being integrated into a conditional GAN. In particular, we force bronchial orifices to match across input and output images. We further propose to use foundation model-generated depth images as intermediate representation ensuring robustness across a variety of input domains establishing models with substantially less reliance on individual training datasets. Moreover our intermediate depth image representation allows to easily construct paired image data for training. Our experiments showed that input images from different domains (e.g. virtual bronchoscopy, phantoms) can be successfully translated to images mimicking realistic human airway appearance. We demonstrated that anatomical settings (i.e. bronchial orifices) can be robustly preserved with our approach which is shown qualitatively and quantitatively by means of improved FID, SSIM and dice coefficients scores. Our anatomical constraints enabled an improvement in the Dice coefficient of up to 0.43 for synthetic images. Through foundation models for intermediate depth representations, bronchial orifice segmentation integrated as anatomical constraints into conditional GANs we are able to robustly translate images from different bronchoscopy input domains. BronchoGAN allows to incorporate public CT scan data (virtual bronchoscopy) in order to generate large-scale bronchoscopy image datasets with realistic appearance. BronchoGAN enables to bridge the gap of missing public bronchoscopy images.",

In addition, we provide a numerical study of reconstruction methods, thereby demonstrating the feasibility and potential of the tomography method.",

Seed-based functional connectivity (FC) analysis enables voxel-wise mapping of the hippocampus's synchronous activity with cortical regions, offering a window into functional reorganization during aging. In this study, we develop an interpretable deep learning framework to predict brain age from hippocampal FC using a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D CNN) combined with LayerCAM saliency mapping. This approach maps key hippocampal-cortical connections, particularly with the precuneus, cuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, parahippocampal cortex, left superior parietal lobule, and right superior temporal sulcus, that are highly sensitive to age. Critically, disaggregating anterior and posterior hippocampal FC reveals distinct mapping aligned with their known functional specializations. These findings provide new insights into the functional mechanisms of hippocampal aging and demonstrate the power of explainable deep learning to uncover biologically meaningful patterns in neuroimaging data.",

This study investigates the neural mechanisms of distractor suppression in MCI patients using EEG and behavioral data during an attention-cueing Eriksen flanker task. A cohort of 56 MCIs and 26 healthy controls (HCs) performed tasks with congruent and incongruent stimuli of varying saliency levels. During these tasks, EEG data were analyzed for alpha band coherence's functional connectivity, focusing on Global Efficiency (GE), while Reaction Time (RT) and Hit Rate (HR) were also collected.\n  Our findings reveal significant interactions between congruency, saliency, and cognitive status on GE, RT, and HR. In HCs, congruent conditions resulted in higher GE (p = 0.0114, multivariate t-distribution correction, MVT), faster RTs (p < 0.0001, MVT), and higher HRs (p < 0.0001, MVT) compared to incongruent conditions. HCs also showed increased GE in salient conditions for incongruent trials (p = 0.0406, MVT). MCIs exhibited benefits from congruent conditions with shorter RTs and higher HRs (both p < 0.0001, MVT) compared to incongruent conditions but showed reduced adaptability in GE, with no significant GE differences between conditions.\n  These results highlight the potential of alpha band coherence and GE as early markers for cognitive impairment. By integrating GE, RT, and HR, this study provides insights into the interplay between neural efficiency, processing speed, and task accuracy. This approach offers valuable insights into cognitive load management and interference effects, indicating benefits for interventions aimed at improving attentional control and processing speed in MCIs.",

However, most existing approaches are limited to scalar equations, with few capable of identifying tensor relationships. In this work, we propose a general data-driven framework for identifying tensor equations, referred to as Symbolic Identification of Tensor Equations (SITE). The core idea of SITE--representing tensor equations using a host-plasmid structure--is inspired by the multidimensional gene expression programming (M-GEP) approach. To improve the robustness of the evolutionary process, SITE adopts a genetic information retention strategy. Moreover, SITE introduces two key innovations beyond conventional evolutionary algorithms. First, it incorporates a dimensional homogeneity check to restrict the search space and eliminate physically invalid expressions. Second, it replaces traditional linear scaling with a tensor linear regression technique, greatly enhancing the efficiency of numerical coefficient optimization. We validate SITE using two benchmark scenarios, where it accurately recovers target equations from synthetic data, showing robustness to noise and small sample sizes. Furthermore, SITE is applied to identify constitutive relations directly from molecular simulation data, which are generated without reliance on macroscopic constitutive models. It adapts to both compressible and incompressible flow conditions and successfully identifies the corresponding macroscopic forms, highlighting its potential for data-driven discovery of tensor equation.",

      "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, scientific understanding related to the topic evolved rapidly. Along with scientific information being discussed widely, a large circulation of false information, labelled an infodemic by the WHO, emerged. Here, we study the interaction between misinformation and science on Twitter (now X) during the COVID-19 pandemic. We built a comprehensive database of $\\sim$407M COVID-19 related tweets and classified the reliability of URLs in the tweets based on Media Bias/Fact Check. In addition, we use Altmetric data to see whether a tweet refers to a scientific publication. We find that many users find that many users share both scientific and unreliable content; out of the $\\sim$1.2M users who share science, $45\\%$ also share unreliable content. Publications that are more frequently shared by users who also share unreliable content are more likely to be preprints, slightly more often retracted, have fewer citations, and are published in lower-impact journals on average. Our findings suggest that misinformation is not related to a ``deficit'' of science. In addition, our findings raise some critical questions about certain open science practices and their potential for misuse. Given the fundamental opposition between science and misinformation, our findings highlight the necessity for proactive scientific engagement on social media platforms to counter false narratives during global crises.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a praxeological analysis of artificial intelligence and algorithmic governance, challenging assumptions about the capacity of machine systems to sustain economic and epistemic order. Drawing on Misesian a priori reasoning and Austrian theories of entrepreneurship, we argue that AI systems are incapable of performing the core functions of economic coordination: interpreting ends, discovering means, and communicating subjective value through prices. Where neoclassical and behavioural models treat decisions as optimisation under constraint, we frame them as purposive actions under uncertainty.\n  We critique dominant ethical AI frameworks such as Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAT) as extensions of constructivist rationalism, which conflict with a liberal order grounded in voluntary action and property rights. Attempts to encode moral reasoning in algorithms reflect a misunderstanding of ethics and economics. However complex, AI systems cannot originate norms, interpret institutions, or bear responsibility. They remain opaque, misaligned, and inert.\n  Using the concept of epistemic scarcity, we explore how information abundance degrades truth discernment, enabling both entrepreneurial insight and soft totalitarianism. Our analysis ends with a civilisational claim: the debate over AI concerns the future of human autonomy, institutional evolution, and reasoned choice. The Austrian tradition, focused on action, subjectivity, and spontaneous order, offers the only coherent alternative to rising computational social control.",

      "abstract": "Accurate identification of meteoroid streams is central to understanding their origins and evolution. However, overlapping clusters and background noise hinder classification, an issue amplified for missions such as ESA's LUMIO that rely on meteor shower observations to infer lunar meteoroid impact parameters. This study evaluates the performance of the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) algorithm for unsupervised meteoroid stream identification, comparing its outcomes with the established Cameras for All-Sky Meteor Surveillance (CAMS) look-up table method. We analyze the CAMS Meteoroid Orbit Database v3.0 using three feature vectors: LUTAB (CAMS geocentric parameters), ORBIT (heliocentric orbital elements), and GEO (adapted geocentric parameters). HDBSCAN is applied with varying minimum cluster sizes and two cluster selection methods (eom and leaf). To align HDBSCAN clusters with CAMS classifications, the Hungarian algorithm determines the optimal mapping. Clustering performance is assessed via the Silhouette score, Normalized Mutual Information, and F1 score, with Principal Component Analysis further supporting the analysis. With the GEO vector, HDBSCAN confirms 39 meteoroid streams, 21 strongly aligning with CAMS. The ORBIT vector identifies 30 streams, 13 with high matching scores. Less active showers pose identification challenges. The eom method consistently yields superior performance and agreement with CAMS. Although HDBSCAN requires careful selection of the minimum cluster size, it delivers robust, internally consistent clusters and outperforms the look-up table method in statistical coherence. These results underscore HDBSCAN's potential as a mathematically consistent alternative for meteoroid stream identification, although further validation is needed to assess physical validity.",

While full GMMs suffer from the overparameterization of their covariance matrices in high-dimensional spaces, spherical GMMs (with isotropic covariance matrices) certainly lack flexibility to fit certain anisotropic distributions. Connecting these two extremes, we introduce a new family of parsimonious GMMs with piecewise-constant covariance eigenvalue profiles. These extend several low-rank models like the celebrated mixtures of probabilistic principal component analyzers (MPPCA), by enabling any possible sequence of eigenvalue multiplicities. If the latter are prespecified, then we can naturally derive an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to learn the mixture parameters. Otherwise, to address the notoriously-challenging issue of jointly learning the mixture parameters and hyperparameters, we propose a componentwise penalized EM algorithm, whose monotonicity is proven. We show the superior likelihood-parsimony tradeoffs achieved by our models on a variety of unsupervised experiments: density fitting, clustering and single-image denoising.",

      "abstract": "Vocoders, encoding speech signals into acoustic features and allowing for speech signal reconstruction from them, have been studied for decades. Recently, the rise of deep learning has particularly driven the development of neural vocoders to generate high-quality speech signals. On the other hand, the existing end-to-end neural vocoders suffer from a black-box nature that blinds the speech production mechanism and the intrinsic structure of speech, resulting in the ambiguity of separately modeling source excitation and resonance characteristics and the loss of flexibly synthesizing or modifying speech with high quality. Moreover, their sequence-wise waveform generation usually requires complicated networks, leading to substantial time consumption. In this work, inspired by the quasi-harmonic model (QHM) that represents speech as sparse components, we combine the neural network and QHM synthesis process to propose a novel framework for the neural vocoder. Accordingly, speech signals can be encoded into autoregressive moving average (ARMA) functions to model the resonance characteristics, yielding accurate estimates of the amplitudes and phases of quasi-harmonics at any frequency. Subsequently, the speech can be resynthesized and arbitrarily modified in terms of pitch shifting and time stretching with high quality, whereas the time consumption and network size decrease. The experiments indicate that the proposed method leverages the strengths of QHM, the ARMA model, and neural networks, leading to the outperformance of our methods over other methods in terms of generation speed, synthesis quality, and modification flexibility.",

      "abstract": "Paired comparison data, where users evaluate items in pairs, play a central role in ranking and preference learning tasks. While ordinal comparison data intuitively offer richer information than binary comparisons, this paper challenges that conventional wisdom. We propose a general parametric framework for modeling ordinal paired comparisons without ties. The model adopts a generalized additive structure, featuring a link function that quantifies the preference difference between two items and a pattern function that governs the distribution over ordinal response levels. This framework encompasses classical binary comparison models as special cases, by treating binary responses as binarized versions of ordinal data. Within this framework, we show that binarizing ordinal data can significantly improve the accuracy of ranking recovery. Specifically, we prove that under the counting algorithm, the ranking error associated with binary comparisons exhibits a faster exponential convergence rate than that of ordinal data. Furthermore, we characterize a substantial performance gap between binary and ordinal data in terms of a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) determined by the pattern function. We identify the pattern function that minimizes the SNR and maximizes the benefit of binarization. Extensive simulations and a real application on the MovieLens dataset further corroborate our theoretical findings.",

Felsenthal [D. Felsenthal. A Well-Behaved Index of a Priori P-Power for Simple N-Person Games. Homo Oeconomicus, 33, 2016] proposed a power index with a focus on least size winning coalitions, i.e., those coalitions capable of determining the final outcome and with the smallest number of players among all winning coalitions. However, the Felsenthal index overlooks pre-existing affinities between the players, a common and impactful factor in real-world political and economic contexts. This paper introduces the Felsenthal Owen power index, a novel index based on Felsenthal's approach that integrates player affinities using Owen's a priori unions framework. The new index is rigorously characterised by two distinct sets of axiomatic properties. We demonstrate its practical utility by applying it to the International Monetary Fund's voting system, revealing how strategic alliances significantly reshape power distributions. The index thus offers policymakers a more sophisticated tool for measuring influence in complex decision-making scenarios.",

Specifically, to enable efficient token representations, we propose a generative information bottleneck (GenIB) principle, which facilitates the learning of tokens that preserve essential information while supporting reliable generation across multiple modalities. By doing this, GenIB-based tokenization is conducive to improving the communication efficiency and reducing computational complexity. Additionally, we develop $\\sigma$-GenIB to address the challenges of variance collapse in autoregressive modeling, maintaining representational diversity and stability. Moreover, we employ a causal Transformer-based multimodal large language model (MLLM) at the receiver to unify the processing of both discrete and continuous tokens under the next-token prediction paradigm. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed UniToCom compared to baselines under dynamic channel conditions. By integrating token processing with MLLMs, UniToCom enables scalable and generalizable communication in favor of multimodal understanding and generation, providing a potential solution for next-generation intelligent communications.",

In this work, we explore contrastive learning as a scalable and robust alternative to supervised approaches for brain age estimation. We introduce a novel contrastive loss function, $\\mathcal{L}^{exp}$, and evaluate it across multiple public neuroimaging datasets comprising over 20,000 scans. Our experiments reveal four key findings. First, scaling pre-training on diverse, multi-site data consistently improves generalization performance, cutting external mean absolute error (MAE) nearly in half. Second, $\\mathcal{L}^{exp}$ is robust to site-related confounds, maintaining low scanner-predictability as training size increases. Third, contrastive models reliably capture accelerated aging in patients with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease, as shown through brain age gap analysis, ROC curves, and longitudinal trends. Lastly, unlike supervised baselines, $\\mathcal{L}^{exp}$ maintains a strong correlation between brain age accuracy and downstream diagnostic performance, supporting its potential as a foundation model for neuroimaging. These results position contrastive learning as a promising direction for building generalizable and clinically meaningful brain representations.",

Traditional, fully-supervised segmentation models rely on large amounts of labeled training data, typically obtained through manual annotation, which can be an expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone process. This signals a need for accurate, automatic, and annotation-efficient methods of training these models. We propose ADA-SAM (automated, domain-specific, and adaptive segment anything model), a novel multitask learning framework for medical image segmentation that leverages class activation maps from an auxiliary classifier to guide the predictions of the semi-supervised segmentation branch, which is based on the Segment Anything (SAM) framework. Additionally, our ADA-SAM model employs a novel gradient feedback mechanism to create a learnable connection between the segmentation and classification branches by using the segmentation gradients to guide and improve the classification predictions. We validate ADA-SAM on real-world clinical data collected during rehabilitation trials, and demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms both fully-supervised and semi-supervised baselines by double digits in limited label settings.

      "abstract": "Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) imaging employed in lung cancer screening (LCS) programs is increasing in uptake worldwide. LCS programs herald a generational opportunity to simultaneously detect cancer and non-cancer-related early-stage lung disease. Yet these efforts are hampered by a shortage of radiologists to interpret scans at scale. Here, we present TANGERINE, a computationally frugal, open-source vision foundation model for volumetric LDCT analysis. Designed for broad accessibility and rapid adaptation, TANGERINE can be fine-tuned off the shelf for a wide range of disease-specific tasks with limited computational resources and training data. Relative to models trained from scratch, TANGERINE demonstrates fast convergence during fine-tuning, thereby requiring significantly fewer GPU hours, and displays strong label efficiency, achieving comparable or superior performance with a fraction of fine-tuning data. Pretrained using self-supervised learning on over 98,000 thoracic LDCTs, including the UK's largest LCS initiative to date and 27 public datasets, TANGERINE achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 disease classification tasks, including lung cancer and multiple respiratory diseases, while generalising robustly across diverse clinical centres. By extending a masked autoencoder framework to 3D imaging, TANGERINE offers a scalable solution for LDCT analysis, departing from recent closed, resource-intensive models by combining architectural simplicity, public availability, and modest computational requirements. Its accessible, open-source lightweight design lays the foundation for rapid integration into next-generation medical imaging tools that could transform LCS initiatives, allowing them to pivot from a singular focus on lung cancer detection to comprehensive respiratory disease management in high-risk populations.",

      "abstract": "Accurate grain orientation mapping is essential for understanding and optimizing the performance of polycrystalline materials, particularly in energy-related applications. Lithium nickel oxide (LiNiO$_{2}$) is a promising cathode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries, and its electrochemical behaviour is closely linked to microstructural features such as grain size and crystallographic orientations. Traditional orientation mapping methods--such as manual indexing, template matching (TM), or Hough transform-based techniques--are often slow and noise-sensitive when handling complex or overlapping patterns, creating a bottleneck in large-scale microstructural analysis. This work presents a machine learning-based approach for predicting Euler angles directly from scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) diffraction patterns (DPs). This enables the automated generation of high-resolution crystal orientation maps, facilitating the analysis of internal microstructures at the nanoscale. Three deep learning architectures--convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Dense Convolutional Networks (DenseNets), and Shifted Windows (Swin) Transformers--are evaluated, using an experimentally acquired dataset labelled via a commercial TM algorithm. While the CNN model serves as a baseline, both DenseNets and Swin Transformers demonstrate superior performance, with the Swin Transformer achieving the highest evaluation scores and the most consistent microstructural predictions. The resulting crystal maps exhibit clear grain boundary delineation and coherent intra-grain orientation distributions, underscoring the potential of attention-based architectures for analyzing diffraction-based image data. These findings highlight the promise of combining advanced machine learning models with STEM data for robust, high-throughput microstructural characterization.",

Herein, we provide insights into cutting these algorithms using local operations (LO) to determine their aptitude for distribution. The key findings of our work are that many of these algorithms cannot be efficiently parallelized using LO, and new methods must be developed to apply electronic structure theory within a DQC framework.",

      "abstract": "Accurately predicting magnetic behavior across diverse materials systems remains a longstanding challenge due to the complex interplay of structural and electronic factors and is pivotal for the accelerated discovery and design of next-generation magnetic materials. In this work, a refined descriptor is proposed that significantly improves the prediction of two critical magnetic properties -- magnetic ordering (Ferromagnetic vs. Ferrimagnetic) and magnetic moment per atom -- using only the structural information of materials. Unlike previous models limited to Mn-based or lanthanide-transition metal compounds, the present approach generalizes across a diverse dataset of 5741 stable, binary and ternary, ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic compounds sourced from the Materials Project. Leveraging an enriched elemental vector representation and advanced feature engineering, including nonlinear terms and reduced matrix sparsity, the LightGBM-based model achieves an accuracy of 82.4% for magnetic ordering classification and balanced recall across FM and FiM classes, addressing a key limitation in prior studies. The model predicts magnetic moment per atom with a correlation coefficient of 0.93, surpassing the Hund's matrix and orbital field matrix descriptors. Additionally, it accurately estimates formation energy per atom, enabling assessment of both magnetic behavior and material stability. This generalized and computationally efficient framework offers a robust tool for high-throughput screening of magnetic materials with tailored properties.",

      "abstract": "We develop a rotation-invariant neural network that provides the global minimum-variance portfolio by jointly learning how to lag-transform historical returns and how to regularise both the eigenvalues and the marginal volatilities of large equity covariance matrices. This explicit mathematical mapping offers clear interpretability of each module's role, so the model cannot be regarded as a pure black-box. The architecture mirrors the analytical form of the global minimum-variance solution yet remains agnostic to dimension, so a single model can be calibrated on panels of a few hundred stocks and applied, without retraining, to one thousand US equities-a cross-sectional jump that demonstrates robust out-of-sample generalisation. The loss function is the future realized minimum portfolio variance and is optimized end-to-end on real daily returns. In out-of-sample tests from January 2000 to December 2024 the estimator delivers systematically lower realised volatility, smaller maximum drawdowns, and higher Sharpe ratios than the best analytical competitors, including state-of-the-art non-linear shrinkage. Furthermore, although the model is trained end-to-end to produce an unconstrained (long-short) minimum-variance portfolio, we show that its learned covariance representation can be used in general optimizers under long-only constraints with virtually no loss in its performance advantage over competing estimators. These gains persist when the strategy is executed under a highly realistic implementation framework that models market orders at the auctions, empirical slippage, exchange fees, and financing charges for leverage, and they remain stable during episodes of acute market stress.",

In contrast to the global KL or Polyak-{\\L}ojasiewicz (PL) conditions commonly assumed in the literature -- which are significantly stronger and often too restrictive in practice -- this local KL condition accommodates a broader range of practical scenarios. However, it also introduces new analytical challenges. In particular, as an optimization algorithm progresses toward a stationary point of the problem, the region over which the KL condition holds may shrink, resulting in a more intricate and potentially ill-conditioned landscape. To address this challenge, we show that the associated maximal function is locally H\\\"older smooth. Leveraging this key property, we develop an inexact proximal gradient method for solving the minimax problem, where the inexact gradient of the maximal function is computed by applying a proximal gradient method to a KL-structured subproblem. Under mild assumptions, we establish complexity guarantees for computing an approximate stationary point of the minimax problem.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language understanding through vast datasets and large-scale parameterization. Inspired by this success, we present SpecCLIP, a foundation model framework that extends LLM-inspired methodologies to stellar spectral analysis. Stellar spectra, akin to structured language, encode rich physical and chemical information about stars. By training foundation models on large-scale spectral datasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support diverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves pre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed by contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different instruments. This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve spectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between spectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information between embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework enabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. We demonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets improves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and chemical-abundance determination. SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and precision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data. Additionally, its similarity search and cross-spectrum prediction capabilities offer potential for anomaly detection. Our results suggest that contrastively trained foundation models enriched with spectrum-aware decoders can advance precision stellar spectroscopy.",

      "abstract": "Biological function arises through the dynamical interactions of multiple subsystems, including those between brain areas, within gene regulatory networks, and more. A common approach to understanding these systems is to model the dynamics of each subsystem and characterize communication between them. An alternative approach is through the lens of control theory: how the subsystems control one another. This approach involves inferring the directionality, strength, and contextual modulation of control between subsystems. However, methods for understanding subsystem control are typically linear and cannot adequately describe the rich contextual effects enabled by nonlinear complex systems. To bridge this gap, we devise a data-driven nonlinear control-theoretic framework to characterize subsystem interactions via the Jacobian of the dynamics. We address the challenge of learning Jacobians from time-series data by proposing the JacobianODE, a deep learning method that leverages properties of the Jacobian to directly estimate it for arbitrary dynamical systems from data alone. We show that JacobianODEs outperform existing Jacobian estimation methods on challenging systems, including high-dimensional chaos. Applying our approach to a multi-area recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on a working memory selection task, we show that the \"sensory\" area gains greater control over the \"cognitive\" area over learning. Furthermore, we leverage the JacobianODE to directly control the trained RNN, enabling precise manipulation of its behavior. Our work lays the foundation for a theoretically grounded and data-driven understanding of interactions among biological subsystems.",

      "abstract": "A set of objects is to be divided fairly among agents with different tastes, modeled by additive utility-functions. If we consider the objects as indivisible, many instances of the decision problem: ``Is there a fair division of the objects among the agents'' are negative. In addition, this question is hard to solve even for most of the special cases. The latter reasons give us a good motivation to relax the problem for which the running time complexity is better, and the number of positive instances (admitting a fair division) will significantly grow. Whereas many works relax the fairness criteria, this paper introduces another relaxation: an agent is allowed to share a \\emph{bounded} number of objects between two or more agents in order to attain fairness. The paper studies various notions of fairness, such as proportionality, envy-freeness, equitability, and consensus. We analyze the run-time complexity of finding a fair allocation with a given number of sharings under several restrictions on the agents' valuations, such as: binary, generalized-binary, and non-degenerate.",

      "abstract": "A learned database system uses machine learning (ML) internally to improve performance. We can expect such systems to be vulnerable to some adversarial-ML attacks. Often, the learned component is shared between mutually-distrusting users or processes, much like microarchitectural resources such as caches, potentially giving rise to highly-realistic attacker models. However, compared to attacks on other ML-based systems, attackers face a level of indirection as they cannot interact directly with the learned model. Additionally, the difference between the attack surface of learned and non-learned versions of the same system is often subtle. These factors obfuscate the de-facto risks that the incorporation of ML carries. We analyze the root causes of potentially-increased attack surface in learned database systems and develop a framework for identifying vulnerabilities that stem from the use of ML. We apply our framework to a broad set of learned components currently being explored in the database community. To empirically validate the vulnerabilities surfaced by our framework, we choose 3 of them and implement and evaluate exploits against these. We show that the use of ML cause leakage of past queries in a database, enable a poisoning attack that causes exponential memory blowup in an index structure and crashes it in seconds, and enable index users to snoop on each others' key distributions by timing queries over their own keys. We find that adversarial ML is an universal threat against learned components in database systems, point to open research gaps in our understanding of learned-systems security, and conclude by discussing mitigations, while noting that data leakage is inherent in systems whose learned component is shared between multiple parties.",

      "abstract": "As a cross-topic of multi-view learning and multi-label classification, multi-view multi-label classification has gradually gained traction in recent years. The application of multi-view contrastive learning has further facilitated this process, however, the existing multi-view contrastive learning methods crudely separate the so-called negative pair, which largely results in the separation of samples belonging to the same category or similar ones. Besides, plenty of multi-view multi-label learning methods ignore the possible absence of views and labels. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose an incomplete multi-view missing multi-label classification network named RANK. In this network, a label-driven multi-view contrastive learning strategy is proposed to leverage supervised information to preserve the intra-view structure and perform the cross-view consistency alignment. Furthermore, we break through the view-level weights inherent in existing methods and propose a quality-aware sub-network to dynamically assign quality scores to each view of each sample. The label correlation information is fully utilized in the final multi-label cross-entropy classification loss, effectively improving the discriminative power. Last but not least, our model is not only able to handle complete multi-view multi-label data, but also works on datasets with missing instances and labels. Extensive experiments confirm that our RANK outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Entity alignment (EA) aims at identifying equivalent entity pairs across different knowledge graphs (KGs) that refer to the same real-world identity. To circumvent the shortage of seed alignments provided for training, recent EA models utilize pseudo-labeling strategies to iteratively add unaligned entity pairs predicted with high confidence to the seed alignments for model training. However, the adverse impact of confirmation bias during pseudo-labeling has been largely overlooked, thus hindering entity alignment performance. To systematically combat confirmation bias for pseudo-labeling-based entity alignment, we propose a Unified Pseudo-Labeling framework for Entity Alignment (UPL-EA) that explicitly eliminates pseudo-labeling errors to boost the accuracy of entity alignment. UPL-EA consists of two complementary components: (1) Optimal Transport (OT)-based pseudo-labeling uses discrete OT modeling as an effective means to determine entity correspondences and reduce erroneous matches across two KGs. An effective criterion is derived to infer pseudo-labeled alignments that satisfy one-to-one correspondences; (2) Parallel pseudo-label ensembling refines pseudo-labeled alignments by combining predictions over multiple models independently trained in parallel. The ensembled pseudo-labeled alignments are thereafter used to augment seed alignments to reinforce subsequent model training for alignment inference. The effectiveness of UPL-EA in eliminating pseudo-labeling errors is both theoretically supported and experimentally validated. Our extensive results and in-depth analyses demonstrate the superiority of UPL-EA over 15 competitive baselines and its utility as a general pseudo-labeling framework for entity alignment.",

      "abstract": "Classification of motor imagery (MI) using non-invasive electroencephalographic (EEG) signals is a critical objective as it is used to predict the intention of limb movements of a subject. In recent research, convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods have been widely utilized for MI-EEG classification. The challenges of training neural networks for MI-EEG signals classification include low signal-to-noise ratio, non-stationarity, non-linearity, and high complexity of EEG signals. The features computed by CNN-based networks on the highly noisy MI-EEG signals contain irrelevant information. Subsequently, the feature maps of the CNN-based network computed from the noisy and irrelevant features contain irrelevant information. Thus, many non-contributing features often mislead the neural network training and degrade the classification performance. Hence, a novel feature reweighting approach is proposed to address this issue. The proposed method gives a noise reduction mechanism named feature reweighting module that suppresses irrelevant temporal and channel feature maps. The feature reweighting module of the proposed method generates scores that reweight the feature maps to reduce the impact of irrelevant information. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improved the classification of MI-EEG signals of Physionet EEG-MMIDB and BCI Competition IV 2a datasets by a margin of 9.34% and 3.82%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Railway networks have become increasingly important in recent times, especially in moving freight and public transportation from road traffic and planes to more environmentally friendly trains. Since expanding the global railway network is time- and resource-consuming, maximizing the rail capacity of the existing infrastructure is desirable. However, simply running more trains is infeasible as certain constraints enforced by the train control system must be satisfied. The capacity of a network depends (amongst others) on the distance between trains allowed by this safety system. While most signaling systems rely on fixed blocks defined by costly hardware, new specifications provided by Level 2 with Hybrid Train Detection of the European Train Control System (ETCS L2 HTD), formerly known as ETCS Hybrid Level 3, allow the usage of virtual subsections. This additional degree of freedom allows for shorter train following times and, thus, more trains on existing railway tracks. On the other hand, new design tasks arise on which automated methods might be helpful for designers of modern railway networks. However, although first approaches exist that solve design problems arising within ETCS L2 HTD, neither formal descriptions nor results on the computational complexity of the corresponding design tasks exist. In this paper, we fill this gap by providing a formal description of design tasks for ETCS L2 HTD and proof that these tasks are NP-complete or NP-hard, respectively. By that, we are providing a solid basis for the future development of methods to solve those tasks, which will be integrated into the Munich Train Control Toolkit available open-source on GitHub at https://github.com/cda-tum/mtct.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel network framework for indoor 3D object detection to handle variable input frame numbers in practical scenarios. Existing methods only consider fixed frames of input data for a single detector, such as monocular RGB-D images or point clouds reconstructed from dense multi-view RGB-D images. While in practical application scenes such as robot navigation and manipulation, the raw input to the 3D detectors is the RGB-D images with variable frame numbers instead of the reconstructed scene point cloud. However, the previous approaches can only handle fixed frame input data and have poor performance with variable frame input. In order to facilitate 3D object detection methods suitable for practical tasks, we present a novel 3D detection framework named AnyView for our practical applications, which generalizes well across different numbers of input frames with a single model. To be specific, we propose a geometric learner to mine the local geometric features of each input RGB-D image frame and implement local-global feature interaction through a designed spatial mixture module. Meanwhile, we further utilize a dynamic token strategy to adaptively adjust the number of extracted features for each frame, which ensures consistent global feature density and further enhances the generalization after fusion. Extensive experiments on the ScanNet dataset show our method achieves both great generalizability and high detection accuracy with a simple and clean architecture containing a similar amount of parameters with the baselines.",

By optimizing synthetic data to align with this barycenter in feature space and leveraging per-class BatchNorm statistics to preserve intra-class variations, WMDD maintains the efficiency of distribution matching approaches while achieving state-of-the-art results across various high-resolution datasets.

While existing quadrupedal-limbed robots have demonstrated impressive dexterous capabilities, achieving a balance between power-demanding locomotion and precise grasping remains a critical challenge. We design a torso mechanism and a parallel-serial limb to meet the conflicting requirements that pose unique challenges in hardware design. SCALER employs underactuated two-fingered GOAT grippers that can mechanically adapt and offer seven modes of grasping, enabling SCALER to traverse extreme terrains with multi-modal grasping strategies. We study the whole-body approach, where SCALER utilizes its body and limbs to generate additional forces for stable grasping in various environments, thereby further enhancing its versatility. Furthermore, we improve the GOAT gripper actuation speed to realize more dynamic climbing in a closed-loop control fashion. With these proposed technologies, SCALER can traverse vertical, overhanging, upside-down, slippery terrains and bouldering walls with non-convex-shaped climbing holds under the Earth's gravity.",

In particular, adding momentum is thought to reduce stochastic noise. To verify this, we estimated the magnitude of gradient noise by using convergence analysis and an optimal batch size estimation formula and found that momentum does not reduce gradient noise. We also analyzed the effect of search direction noise, which is stochastic noise defined as the error between the search direction of the optimizer and the steepest descent direction, and found that it inherently smooths the objective function and that momentum does not reduce search direction noise either. Finally, an analysis of the degree of smoothing introduced by search direction noise revealed that adding momentum offers limited advantage to SGD.",

      "abstract": "A growing trend has emerged in designing high-quality Small Language Models (SLMs) with a few million parameters. This trend is driven by the increasing concerns over cloud costs, privacy, and latency. Considering that full parameter training is feasible for SLMs on mobile devices, Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is employed to improve efficiency by reducing computational overhead and memory footprint. However, previous QAT works adopt fine-grained quantization methods to compress models with billions of parameters on GPUs, incompatible with current commodity hardware, such as mobile and edge devices, which relies on Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) instructions. Thus, the generalization of these methods to SLMs on mobile devices is limited. In this paper, we propose Squat method, an effective QAT framework with deployable quantization for SLMs on mobile devices. Specifically, we propose entropy-guided and distribution-aligned distillation to mitigate the distortion of attention information from quantization. Besides, we employ sub-8-bit token adaptive quantization, assigning varying bit widths to different tokens based on their importance. Furthermore, we develop a SIMD-based Multi-Kernel Mixed-Precision (MKMP) multiplier to support sub-8-bit mixed-precision MAC on mobile devices. Our extensive experiments verify the substantial improvements of our method compared to other QAT methods across various datasets. Furthermore, we achieve an on-device speedup of up to 2.37x compared with its FP16 counterparts, signaling a great advancement. Code: https://github.com/shawnricecake/squant",

      "abstract": "Embedded AI systems are expected to incur low power/energy consumption for solving machine learning tasks, as these systems are usually power constrained (e.g., object recognition task in autonomous mobile agents with portable batteries). These requirements can be fulfilled by Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), since their bio-inspired spike-based operations offer high accuracy and ultra low-power/energy computation. Currently, most of SNN architectures are derived from Artificial Neural Networks whose neurons' architectures and operations are different from SNNs, and/or developed without considering memory budgets from the underlying processing hardware of embedded platforms. These limitations hinder SNNs from reaching their full potential in accuracy and efficiency. Toward this, we propose SpikeNAS, a novel fast memory-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework for SNNs that quickly finds an appropriate SNN architecture with high accuracy under the given memory budgets from targeted embedded systems. To do this, our SpikeNAS employs several key steps: analyzing the impacts of network operations on the accuracy, enhancing the network architecture to improve the learning quality, developing a fast memory-aware search algorithm, and performing quantization. The experimental results show that our SpikeNAS improves the searching time and maintains high accuracy compared to state-of-the-art while meeting the given memory budgets (e.g., 29x, 117x, and 3.7x faster search for CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet200 respectively, using an Nvidia RTX A6000 GPU machine), thereby quickly providing the appropriate SNN architecture for the memory-constrained embedded AI systems.",

      "abstract": "Robots are becoming an increasingly common part of scientific work within laboratory environments. In this paper, we investigate the problem of designing \\emph{schedules} for completing a set of tasks at fixed locations with multiple robots in a laboratory. We represent the laboratory as a graph with tasks placed on fixed vertices and robots represented as agents, with the constraint that no two robots may occupy the same vertex at any given timestep. Each schedule is partitioned into a set of timesteps, corresponding to a walk through the graph (allowing for a robot to wait at a vertex to complete a task), with each timestep taking time equal to the time for a robot to move from one vertex to another and each task taking some given number of timesteps during the completion of which a robot must stay at the vertex containing the task. The goal is to determine a set of schedules, with one schedule for each robot, minimising the number of timesteps taken by the schedule taking the greatest number of timesteps within the set of schedules.\n  We show that this problem is NP-complete for many simple classes of graphs, the problem of determining the fastest schedule, defined by the number of time steps required for a robot to visit every vertex in the schedule and complete every task assigned in its assigned schedule. Explicitly, we provide this result for complete graphs, bipartite graphs, star graphs, and planar graphs. Finally, we provide positive results for line graphs, showing that we can find an optimal set of schedules for $k$ robots completing $m$ tasks of equal length of a path of length $n$ in $O(kmn)$ time, and a $k$-approximation when the length of the tasks is unbounded.",

      "abstract": "Previous studies in predicting crash risks primarily associated the number or likelihood of crashes on a road segment with traffic parameters or geometric characteristics, usually neglecting the impact of vehicles' continuous movement and interactions with nearby vehicles. Recent technology advances, such as Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are able to collect high-resolution trajectory data, which enables trajectory-based risk analysis. This study investigates a new vehicle group (VG) based risk analysis method and explores risk evolution mechanisms considering VG features. An impact-based vehicle grouping method is proposed to cluster vehicles into VGs by evaluating their responses to the erratic behaviors of nearby vehicles. The risk of a VG is aggregated based on the risk between each vehicle pair in the VG, measured by inverse Time-to-Collision (iTTC). A Logistic Regression and a Graph Neural Network (GNN) are then employed to predict VG risks using aggregated and disaggregated VG information. Both methods achieve excellent performance with AUC values exceeding 0.93. For the GNN model, GNNExplainer with feature perturbation is applied to identify critical individual vehicle features and their directional impact on VG risks. Overall, this research contributes a new perspective for identifying, predicting, and interpreting traffic risks.",

Sufficient conditions have been provided for the unique determination of both the linear quadratic cost function as well as the target state. A computationally efficient and numerically reliable parameter identification algorithm is proposed by equating optimal control strategies with a system of linear equations, and the associated relative error upper bound is derived in terms of data volume and signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, the proposed inverse optimal control algorithm is applied for the joint cluster coordination and intent identification of a multi-agent system. By incorporating the structural constraint of the Laplace matrix, the relative error upper bound can be reduced accordingly. Finally, the algorithm's efficiency and accuracy are validated by a vehicle-on-a-lever example and a multi-agent formation control example.",

Such miscalibration, challenges their clinical translation. We propose to use marginal L1 average calibration error (mL1-ACE) as a novel auxiliary loss function to improve pixel-wise calibration without compromising segmentation quality. We show that this loss, despite using hard binning, is directly differentiable, bypassing the need for approximate but differentiable surrogate or soft binning approaches. Our work also introduces the concept of dataset reliability histograms which generalises standard reliability diagrams for refined visual assessment of calibration in semantic segmentation aggregated at the dataset level. Using mL1-ACE, we reduce average and maximum calibration error by 45% and 55% respectively, maintaining a Dice score of 87% on the BraTS 2021 dataset.

The goal is to take both agent actions and environment configurations as decision variables, and optimize these two components in a coordinated manner to improve some measure of interest. Towards this end, we consider the problem of decentralized multi-agent navigation in a cluttered environment, where we assume that the layout of the environment is reconfigurable. By introducing two sub-objectives -- multi-agent navigation and environment optimization -- we propose an agent-environment co-optimization problem and develop a coordinated algorithm that alternates between these sub-objectives to search for an optimal synthesis of agent actions and environment configurations; ultimately, improving the navigation performance. Due to the challenge of explicitly modeling the relation between the agents, the environment and their performance therein, we leverage policy gradient to formulate a model-free learning mechanism within the coordinated framework. A formal convergence analysis shows that our coordinated algorithm tracks the local minimum solution of an associated time-varying non-convex optimization problem. Experiments corroborate theoretical findings and show the benefits of co-optimization. Interestingly, the results also indicate that optimized environments can offer structural guidance to de-conflict agents in motion.",

      "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) presents distinct challenges as it relies solely on observational data. A central concern in this context is ensuring the safety of the learned policy by quantifying uncertainties associated with various actions and environmental stochasticity. Traditional approaches primarily emphasize mitigating epistemic uncertainty by learning risk-averse policies, often overlooking environmental stochasticity. In this study, we propose an uncertainty-aware distributional offline RL method to simultaneously address both epistemic uncertainty and environmental stochasticity. We propose a model-free offline RL algorithm capable of learning risk-averse policies and characterizing the entire distribution of discounted cumulative rewards, as opposed to merely maximizing the expected value of accumulated discounted returns. Our method is rigorously evaluated through comprehensive experiments in both risk-sensitive and risk-neutral benchmarks, demonstrating its superior performance.",

However, existing SAT solvers, optimized for Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), often struggle with the intrinsic complexity of circuit structures when directly applied to CSAT instances. To address this challenge, we propose a novel preprocessing framework that leverages advanced logic synthesis techniques and a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to optimize CSAT problem instances. The framework introduces a cost-customized Look-Up Table (LUT) mapping strategy that prioritizes solving efficiency, effectively transforming circuits into simplified forms tailored for SAT solvers. Our method achieves significant runtime reductions across diverse industrial-scale CSAT benchmarks, seamlessly integrating with state-of-the-art SAT solvers. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate up to 63\\% reduction in solving time compared to conventional approaches, highlighting the potential of EDA-driven innovations to advance SAT-solving capabilities.",

One category of such attacks reformulates the task as an optimization problem, aiming to elicit affirmative responses from the LLM. However, these methods heavily rely on predefined objectionable behaviors, limiting their effectiveness and adaptability to diverse harmful queries. In this study, we first identify why the vanilla target loss is suboptimal and then propose enhancements to the loss objective. We introduce DSN (Don't Say No) attack, which combines a cosine decay schedule method with refusal suppression to achieve higher success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSN outperforms baseline attacks and achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates (ASR).

The recent emergence of neural implicit representations has introduced significant advances to these domains, enabling numerous novel capabilities. Among these, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have gained considerable attention because of their considerable representational advantages, such as simplified mathematical models, low memory footprint, and continuous scene representations. In addition to computer vision, NeRFs have demonstrated significant potential in robotics. Thus, we present this survey to provide a comprehensive understanding of NeRFs in the field of robotics. By exploring the advantages and limitations of NeRF as well as its current applications and future potential, we aim to provide an overview of this promising area of research. Our survey is divided into two main sections: \\textit{Applications of NeRFs in Robotics} and \\textit{Advances for NeRFs in Robotics}, from the perspective of how NeRF enters the field of robotics. In the first section, we introduce and analyze some works that have been or could be used in robotics for perception and interaction tasks. In the second section, we show some works related to improving NeRF's own properties, which are essential for deploying NeRFs in robotics. In the discussion section of the review, we summarize the existing challenges and provide valuable future research directions.",

This idea has sparked a blend of excitement and apprehension. However, a critical piece that has been missing in this discourse is a systematic evaluation of LLMs' semantic diversity, particularly in comparison to human divergent thinking. To bridge this gap, we leverage recent advances in computational creativity to analyze semantic divergence in both state-of-the-art LLMs and a substantial dataset of 100,000 humans. We found evidence that LLMs can surpass average human performance on the Divergent Association Task, and approach human creative writing abilities, though they fall short of the typical performance of highly creative humans. Notably, even the top performing LLMs are still largely surpassed by highly creative individuals, underscoring a ceiling that current LLMs still fail to surpass. Our human-machine benchmarking framework addresses the polemic surrounding the imminent replacement of human creative labour by AI, disentangling the quality of the respective creative linguistic outputs using established objective measures. While prompting deeper exploration of the distinctive elements of human inventive thought compared to those of AI systems, we lay out a series of techniques to improve their outputs with respect to semantic diversity, such as prompt design and hyper-parameter tuning.",

      "abstract": "The Vision Transformer (ViT) has gained prominence for its superior relational modeling prowess. However, its global attention mechanism's quadratic complexity poses substantial computational burdens. A common remedy spatially groups tokens for self-attention, reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless, this strategy neglects semantic information in tokens, possibly scattering semantically-linked tokens across distinct groups, thus compromising the efficacy of self-attention intended for modeling inter-token dependencies. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a fast and balanced clustering method, named Semantic Equitable Clustering (SEC). SEC clusters tokens based on their global semantic relevance in an efficient, straightforward manner. In contrast to traditional clustering methods requiring multiple iterations, our method achieves token clustering in a single pass. Additionally, SEC regulates the number of tokens per cluster, ensuring a balanced distribution for effective parallel processing on current computational platforms without necessitating further optimization. Capitalizing on SEC, we propose a versatile vision backbone, SECViT. Comprehensive experiments in image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation validate the effectiveness of SECViT. Moreover, SEC can be conveniently and swiftly applied to multimodal large language models (MLLM), such as LLaVA, to serve as a vision language connector, effectively accelerating the model's efficiency while maintaining unchanged or better performance.",

The integration of deep learning models has facilitated the development of precise and automated segmentation methods. Although prior research has explored teeth segmentation, not many methods have successfully performed tooth segmentation and detection simultaneously. This study presents UFBA-425, a dental dataset derived from the UFBA-UESC dataset, featuring bounding box and polygon annotations for 425 panoramic dental X-rays. In addition, this paper presents the OralBBNet architecture, which is based on the best segmentation and detection qualities of architectures such as U-Net and YOLOv8, respectively. OralBBNet is designed to improve the accuracy and robustness of tooth classification and segmentation on panoramic X-rays by leveraging the complementary strengths of U-Net and YOLOv8. Our approach achieved a 1-3% improvement in mean average precision (mAP) for tooth detection compared to existing techniques and a 15-20% improvement in the dice score for teeth segmentation over state-of-the-art (SOTA) solutions for various tooth categories and 2-4% improvement in the dice score compared to other SOTA segmentation architectures. The results of this study establish a foundation for the wider implementation of object detection models in dental diagnostics.",

      "abstract": "In remote control systems, transmitting large data volumes (e.g., images, video frames) from wireless sensors to remote controllers is challenging when uplink capacity is limited (e.g., RedCap devices or massive wireless sensor networks). Furthermore, controllers often need only information-rich representations of the original data. To address this, we propose a semantic-driven predictive control combined with a channel-aware scheduling to enhance control performance for multiple devices under limited network capacity. At its core, the proposed framework, coined Time-Series Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (TS-JEPA), encodes high-dimensional sensory data into low-dimensional semantic embeddings at the sensor, reducing communication overhead. Furthermore, TS-JEPA enables predictive inference by predicting future embeddings from current ones and predicted commands, which are directly used by a semantic actor model to compute control commands within the embedding space, eliminating the need to reconstruct raw data. To further enhance reliability and communication efficiency, a channel-aware scheduling is integrated to dynamically prioritize device transmissions based on channel conditions and age of information (AoI). Simulations on inverted cart-pole systems show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms conventional control baselines in communication efficiency, control cost, and predictive accuracy. It enables robust and scalable control under limited network capacity compared to traditional scheduling schemes.",

      "abstract": "The utilisation of event cameras represents an important and swiftly evolving trend aimed at addressing the constraints of traditional video systems. Particularly within the automotive domain, these cameras find significant relevance for their integration into embedded real-time systems due to lower latency and energy consumption. One effective approach to ensure the necessary throughput and latency for event processing is through the utilisation of graph convolutional networks (GCNs). In this study, we introduce a custom EFGCN (Event-based FPGA-accelerated Graph Convolutional Network) designed with a series of hardware-aware optimisations tailored for PointNetConv, a graph convolution designed for point cloud processing. The proposed techniques result in up to 100-fold reduction in model size compared to Asynchronous Event-based GNN (AEGNN), one of the most recent works in the field, with a relatively small decrease in accuracy (2.9% for the N-Caltech101 classification task, 2.2% for the N-Cars classification task), thus following the TinyML trend. We implemented EFGCN on a ZCU104 SoC FPGA platform without any external memory resources, achieving a throughput of 13.3 million events per second (MEPS) and real-time partially asynchronous processing with low latency. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple event-based classification benchmarks while remaining highly scalable, customisable and resource-efficient.

We show that we can build a neural radiance field (NeRF) representation of the city -- online -- using RGB and depth images from different vantage points. This representation is used to calculate the information gain to both explore unknown parts of the city and track the targets -- thereby giving a completely first-principles approach to actively tracking dynamic targets. We demonstrate, using a custom-built simulator using Open Street Maps data of Philadelphia and New York City, that we can explore and locate 20 stationary targets within 300 steps. This is slower than a greedy baseline, which does not use active perception. But for dynamic targets that actively hide behind occlusions, we show that our approach maintains, at worst, a tracking error of 200m; the greedy baseline can have a tracking error as large as 600m. We observe a number of interesting properties in the scout's policies, e.g., it switches its attention to track a different target periodically, as the quality of the NeRF representation improves over time, the scout also becomes better in terms of target tracking.

They can be learned in two ways: consistency distillation and consistency training. The former relies on the true velocity field of the corresponding differential equation, approximated by a pre-trained neural network. In contrast, the latter uses a single-sample Monte Carlo estimate of this velocity field. The related estimation error induces a discrepancy between consistency distillation and training that, we show, still holds in the continuous-time limit. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel flow that transports noisy data towards their corresponding outputs derived from a consistency model. We prove that this flow reduces the previously identified discrepancy and the noise-data transport cost. Consequently, our method not only accelerates consistency training convergence but also enhances its overall performance.

      "abstract": "Enabling embodied agents to complete complex human instructions from natural language is crucial to autonomous systems in household services. Conventional methods can only accomplish human instructions in the known environment where all interactive objects are provided to the embodied agent, and directly deploying the existing approaches for the unknown environment usually generates infeasible plans that manipulate non-existing objects. On the contrary, we propose an embodied instruction following (EIF) method for complex tasks in the unknown environment, where the agent efficiently explores the unknown environment to generate feasible plans with existing objects to accomplish abstract instructions. Specifically, we build a hierarchical embodied instruction following framework including the high-level task planner and the low-level exploration controller with multimodal large language models. We then construct a semantic representation map of the scene with dynamic region attention to demonstrate the known visual clues, where the goal of task planning and scene exploration is aligned for human instruction. For the task planner, we generate the feasible step-by-step plans for human goal accomplishment according to the task completion process and the known visual clues. For the exploration controller, the optimal navigation or object interaction policy is predicted based on the generated step-wise plans and the known visual clues. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve 45.09% success rate in 204 complex human instructions such as making breakfast and tidying rooms in large house-level scenes.

      "abstract": "Recent advances in large text-conditional diffusion models have revolutionized image generation by enabling users to create realistic, high-quality images from textual prompts, significantly enhancing artistic creation and visual communication. However, these advancements also introduce an underexplored attack opportunity: the possibility of inducing biases by an adversary into the generated images for malicious intentions, e.g., to influence public opinion and spread propaganda. In this paper, we study an attack vector that allows an adversary to inject arbitrary bias into a target model. The attack leverages low-cost backdooring techniques using a targeted set of natural textual triggers embedded within a small number of malicious data samples produced with public generative models. An adversary could pick common sequences of words that can then be inadvertently activated by benign users during inference. We investigate the feasibility and challenges of such attacks, demonstrating how modern generative models have made this adversarial process both easier and more adaptable. On the other hand, we explore various aspects of the detectability of such attacks and demonstrate that the model's utility remains intact in the absence of the triggers. Our extensive experiments using over 200,000 generated images and against hundreds of fine-tuned models demonstrate the feasibility of the presented backdoor attack. We illustrate how these biases maintain strong text-image alignment, highlighting the challenges in detecting biased images without knowing that bias in advance. Our cost analysis confirms the low financial barrier ($10-$15) to executing such attacks, underscoring the need for robust defensive strategies against such vulnerabilities in diffusion models.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expressions are subtle facial movements that occur spontaneously when people try to conceal real emotions. Micro-expression recognition is crucial in many fields, including criminal analysis and psychotherapy. However, micro-expression recognition is challenging since micro-expressions have low intensity and public datasets are small in size. To this end, a three-stream temporal-shift attention network based on self-knowledge distillation is proposed in this paper. Firstly, to address the low intensity of muscle movements, we utilize learning-based motion magnification modules to enhance the intensity of muscle movements. Secondly, we employ efficient channel attention modules in the local-spatial stream to make the network focus on facial regions that are highly relevant to micro-expressions. In addition, temporal shift modules are used in the dynamic-temporal stream, which enables temporal modeling with no additional parameters by mixing motion information from two different temporal domains. Furthermore, we introduce self-knowledge distillation into the micro-expression recognition task by introducing auxiliary classifiers and using the deepest section of the network for supervision, encouraging all blocks to fully explore the features of the training set. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on five publicly available micro-expression datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our network outperforms other existing methods and achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a theoretical framework to evaluate and compare the performance of stochastic gradient algorithms for distributed learning in relation to their behavior around local minima in nonconvex environments. Previous works have noticed that convergence toward flat local minima tend to enhance the generalization ability of learning algorithms. This work discovers three interesting results. First, it shows that decentralized learning strategies are able to escape faster away from local minima and favor convergence toward flatter minima relative to the centralized solution. Second, in decentralized methods, the consensus strategy has a worse excess-risk performance than diffusion, giving it a better chance of escaping from local minima and favoring flatter minima. Third, and importantly, the ultimate classification accuracy is not solely dependent on the flatness of the local minimum but also on how well a learning algorithm can approach that minimum. In other words, the classification accuracy is a function of both flatness and optimization performance. In this regard, since diffusion has a lower excess-risk than consensus, when both algorithms are trained starting from random initial points, diffusion enhances the classification accuracy. The paper examines the interplay between the two measures of flatness and optimization error closely. One important conclusion is that decentralized strategies deliver in general enhanced classification accuracy because they strike a more favorable balance between flatness and optimization performance compared to the centralized solution.",

      "abstract": "Sharding has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing blockchain system scalability. However, existing sharding approaches face unique challenges when applied to Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based protocols that integrate expressive smart contract processing. Current solutions predominantly rely on coordination mechanisms like 2PC and require transaction read/write sets to optimize parallel execution. These requirements introduce two fundamental limitations: 1) additional coordination phases incur latency overhead, and 2) pre-declaration of read/write sets proves impractical for Turing-complete smart contracts with dynamic access patterns.\n  This paper presents Thunderbolt, a novel sharding architecture for both single-shard transactions (Single-shard TXs) and cross-shard transactions (Cross-shard TXs) and enables nonblocking reconfiguration to ensure system liveness. Our design introduces 4 key innovations: 1) each replica serves dual roles as a full-shard representative and transaction proposer, employing the Execution-Order-Validation (EOV) model for Single-shard TXs and Order-Execution (OE) model for Cross-shard TXs. 2) we develop a DAG-based coordination protocol that establishes deterministic ordering between two transaction types while preserving concurrent execution capabilities. 3) we implement a dynamic concurrency controller that schedules Single-shard TXs without requiring prior knowledge of read/write sets, enabling runtime dependency resolution. 4) Thunderbolt introduces a nonblocking shard reconfiguration mechanism to address censorship attacks by featuring frequent shard re-assignment without impeding the construction of DAG nor blocking consensus. Thunderbolt achieves a 50x throughput improvement with 64 replicas compared to serial execution in the Tusk framework.",

We apply a model-free approach that relies neither on knowledge of model parameters nor on their estimations, and devise an RL algorithm to learn the optimal policy parameter directly. Our main contributions include the introduction of an exploration schedule and a regret analysis of the proposed algorithm. We provide the convergence rate of the policy parameter to the optimal one, and prove that the algorithm achieves a regret bound of $O(N^{\\frac{3}{4}})$ up to a logarithmic factor, where $N$ is the number of learning episodes. We conduct a simulation study to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed algorithm. We also perform numerical comparisons between our method and those of the recent model-based stochastic LQ RL studies adapted to the state- and control-dependent volatility setting, demonstrating a better performance of the former in terms of regret bounds.",

To this end, we provide perspectives on various aspects within the context of developing digital twins for CPSs, where foundation models can be used to increase the efficiency of creating digital twins, improve the effectiveness of the capabilities they provide, and used as specialized fine-tuned foundation models acting as digital twins themselves. We also discuss challenges in using foundation models in a more generic context. We use the case of an autonomous driving system as a representative CPS to give examples. Finally, we provide discussions and open research directions that we believe are valuable for the digital twin community.",

A general scenario is proposed where both the user and the agent are benign, and the environment, while not malicious, contains unrelated content. A wide range of MLLMs are evaluated as GUI agents using a simulated dataset, following three working patterns with different levels of perception. Experimental results reveal that even the most powerful models, whether generalist agents or specialist GUI agents, are susceptible to distractions. While recent studies predominantly focus on the helpfulness of agents, our findings first indicate that these agents are prone to environmental distractions. Furthermore, we implement an adversarial environment injection and analyze the approach to improve faithfulness, calling for a collective focus on this important topic.",

      "abstract": "In the era of Web3, decentralized technologies have emerged as the cornerstone of a new digital paradigm. Backed by a decentralized blockchain architecture, the Web3 space aims to democratize all aspects of the web. From data-sharing to learning models, outsourcing computation is an established, prevalent practice. Verifiable computation makes this practice trustworthy as clients/users can now efficiently validate the integrity of a computation. As verifiable computation gets considered for applications in the Web3 space, decentralization is crucial for system reliability, ensuring that no single entity can suppress clients. At the same time, however, decentralization needs to be balanced with efficiency: clients want their computations done as quickly as possible.\n  Motivated by these issues, we study the trade-off between decentralization and efficiency when outsourcing computational tasks to strategic, rational solution providers. Specifically, we examine this trade-off when the client employs (1) revelation mechanisms, i.e. auctions, where solution providers bid their desired reward for completing the task by a specific deadline and then the client selects which of them will do the task and how much they will be rewarded, and (2) simple, non-revelation mechanisms, where the client commits to the set of rules she will use to map solutions at specific times to rewards and then solution providers decide whether they want to do the task or not. We completely characterize the power and limitations of revelation and non-revelation mechanisms in our model.",

      "abstract": "We are living in a flourishing era of digital media, where everyone has the potential to become a personal filmmaker. Current research on video generation suggests a promising avenue for controllable film creation in pixel space using Diffusion models. However, the reliance on overly verbose prompts and insufficient focus on cinematic elements (e.g., camera movement) results in videos that lack cinematic quality. Furthermore, the absence of 3D modeling often leads to failures in video generation, such as inconsistent character models at different frames, ultimately hindering the immersive experience for viewers. In this paper, we propose a new framework for film creation, Dream-Cinema, which is designed for user-friendly, 3D space-based film creation with generative models. Specifically, we decompose 3D film creation into four key elements: 3D character, driven motion, camera movement, and environment. We extract the latter three elements from user-specified film shots and generate the 3D character using a generative model based on a provided image. To seamlessly recombine these elements and ensure smooth film creation, we propose structure-guided character animation, shape-aware camera movement optimization, and environment-aware generative refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating high-quality films with free camera and 3D characters.",

      "abstract": "The standard theory of musical scales since antiquity has been based on harmony, rather than melody. While recent analyses provide mixed support for a role of melody as well as harmony, we lack a comparative analysis based on cross-cultural data. We address this longstanding problem through a rigorous computational comparison of the main theories using 1,314 scales from 96 countries. There is near-universal support for melodic theories, which predict step-sizes of 1-3 semitones. Harmony accounts for the prevalence of certain simple-integer-ratio intervals, particularly for music-theoretic scales from Eurasian societies, which may explain their dominance amongst Western scholars. However, harmony is a poor predictor of scales measured from ethnographic recordings, particularly outside of Eurasia. Overall, we show that the historical emphasis on harmony is misguided and that melody is the primary determinant of the world's musical scales.",

The original development of containers is done in the internal language of locally cartesian closed categories (LCCCs) with disjoint coproducts and W-types, and uniqueness of identity proofs (UIP) is implicitly assumed throughout. Although it is claimed that these developments can also be interpreted in extensional Martin-L\\\"of type theory, this interpretation is not made explicit. In this paper, we present a formalisation of the results that 'containers preserve least and greatest fixed points' in Cubical Agda, thereby giving a formulation in intensional type theory. Our proofs do not make use of UIP and thereby generalise the original results from talking about container functors on Set to container functors on the wild category of types. Our main incentive for using Cubical Agda is that its path type restores the equivalence between bisimulation and coinductive equality. Thus, besides developing container theory in a more general setting, we also demonstrate the usefulness of Cubical Agda's path type to coinductive proofs.",

In contrast to existing works in certified unlearning for convex or strongly convex loss functions, or nonconvex objectives with limiting assumptions, we propose the first, first-order, black-box (i.e., can be applied to models pretrained with vanilla gradient descent) algorithm for unlearning on general nonconvex loss functions, which unlearns by ``rewinding\" to an earlier step during the learning process before performing gradient descent on the loss function of the retained data points. We prove $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$ certified unlearning and performance guarantees that establish the privacy-utility-complexity tradeoff of our algorithm, and we prove generalization guarantees for functions that satisfy the Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm compared to existing methods, within a new experimental framework that more accurately reflects unlearning user data in practice.",

This work presents a practical approach to address these challenges through an unexplored combination of an NE bias list and a word-level n-gram language model (LM). This solution balances simplicity and effectiveness, improving entities' recognition while maintaining or even enhancing overall ASR performance. We efficiently integrate this enriched biasing method into a transducer-based ASR system, enabling context adaptation with almost no computational overhead. We present our results on three datasets spanning four languages and compare them to state-of-the-art biasing strategies. We demonstrate that the proposed combination of keyword biasing and n-gram LM improves entity recognition by up to 32% relative and reduces overall WER by up to a 12% relative.",

We propose a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation for the considered NS problem that can flexibly route the traffic flow of the services on multiple paths and provide end-to-end delay and reliability guarantees for all services. To overcome the computational difficulty due to the intrinsic nonlinearity in the MINLP formulation, we transform the MINLP formulation into an equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation and further show that their continuous relaxations are equivalent. In sharp contrast to the continuous relaxation of the MINLP formulation which is a nonconvex nonlinear programming problem, the continuous relaxation of the MILP formulation is a polynomial-time solvable linear programming problem, which significantly facilitates the algorithmic design. Based on the newly proposed MILP formulation, we develop a customized column generation (cCG) algorithm for solving the NS problem. The proposed cCG algorithm is a decomposition-based algorithm and is particularly suitable for solving large-scale NS problems. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed formulations and the proposed cCG algorithm.",

Accurate modeling of these devices is necessary. In this paper, a system identification approach to obtain low-dimensional models of grid-forming inverters is presented. The proposed approach is based on a Hammerstein-Wiener parametrization of the normal-form model. The normal-form is a gray-box model that utilizes complex frequency and phase to capture non-linear inverter dynamics. The model is validated on two well-known control strategies: droop-control and dispatchable virtual oscillators. Simulations and hardware-in-the-loop experiments demonstrate that the normal-form accurately models inverter dynamics across various operating conditions. The approach shows great potential for enhancing the modeling of RES-dominated power systems, especially when component models are unavailable or computationally expensive.",

      "abstract": "Understanding human mobility patterns has long been a challenging task in transportation modeling. Due to the difficulties in obtaining high-quality training datasets across diverse locations, conventional activity-based models and learning-based human mobility modeling algorithms are particularly limited by the availability and quality of datasets. Current approaches primarily focus on spatial-temporal patterns while neglecting semantic relationships such as logical connections or dependencies between activities and household coordination activities like joint shopping trips or family meal times, both crucial for realistic mobility modeling. We propose a retrieval-augmented large language model (LLM) framework that generates activity chains with household coordination using only public accessible statistical and socio-demographic information, reducing the need for sophisticated mobility data. The retrieval-augmentation mechanism enables household coordination and maintains statistical consistency across generated patterns, addressing a key gap in existing methods. Our validation with NHTS and SCAG-ABM datasets demonstrates effective mobility synthesis and strong adaptability for regions with limited mobility data availability.",

Deep learning has enhanced EEG analysis, enabling meaningful pattern detection for clinical and research purposes. However, most existing frameworks for EEG data analysis are either focused on preprocessing techniques or deep learning model development, often overlooking the crucial need for structured documentation and model interpretability. In this paper, we introduce DREAMS (Deep REport for AI ModelS), a Python-based framework designed to generate automated model cards for deep learning models applied to EEG data. Unlike generic model reporting tools, DREAMS is specifically tailored for EEG-based deep learning applications, incorporating domain-specific metadata, preprocessing details, performance metrics, and uncertainty quantification. The framework seamlessly integrates with deep learning pipelines, providing structured YAML-based documentation. We evaluate DREAMS through two case studies: an EEG emotion classification task using the FACED dataset and a abnormal EEG classification task using the Temple Univeristy Hospital (TUH) Abnormal dataset. These evaluations demonstrate how the generated model card enhances transparency by documenting model performance, dataset biases, and interpretability limitations. Unlike existing model documentation approaches, DREAMS provides visualized performance metrics, dataset alignment details, and model uncertainty estimations, making it a valuable tool for researchers and clinicians working with EEG-based AI. The source code for DREAMS is open-source, facilitating broad adoption in healthcare AI, research, and ethical AI development.",

We begin by exploring the motivations driving this research. We then present core techniques used in SAM and model acceleration. This is followed by a detailed exploration of SAM acceleration strategies, categorized by approach, and a discussion of several future research directions.

Existing approaches, such as Task Arithmetic, fine-tune the model on the forget set to create a task vector (i.e., a direction in weight space) for subtraction from the original model's weight. However, their effectiveness is highly sensitive to hyperparameter selection, requiring extensive validation to identify the optimal vector from many fine-tuned candidates. In this paper, we propose a novel method that utilizes all fine-tuned models trained with varying hyperparameters instead of a single selection. Specifically, we aggregate the computed task vectors by retaining only the elements with consistent shared signs. The merged task vector is then negated to induce unlearning on the original model. Evaluations on zero-shot and standard image recognition tasks across twelve datasets and four backbone architectures show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods while requiring similar or fewer computational resources.

      "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used across various applications, there is a growing need to control text generation to satisfy specific constraints or requirements. This raises a crucial question: Is it possible to guarantee strict constraint satisfaction in generated outputs while preserving the distribution of the original model as much as possible? We first define the ideal distribution - the one closest to the original model, which also always satisfies the expressed constraint - as the ultimate goal of guaranteed generation. We then state a fundamental limitation, namely that it is impossible to reach that goal through autoregressive training alone. This motivates the necessity of combining training-time and inference-time methods to enforce such guarantees. Based on this insight, we propose GUARD, a simple yet effective approach that combines an autoregressive proposal distribution with rejection sampling. Through GUARD's theoretical properties, we show how controlling the KL divergence between a specific proposal and the target ideal distribution simultaneously optimizes inference speed and distributional closeness. To validate these theoretical concepts, we conduct extensive experiments on two text generation settings with hard-to-satisfy constraints: a lexical constraint scenario and a sentiment reversal scenario. These experiments show that GUARD achieves perfect constraint satisfaction while almost preserving the ideal distribution with highly improved inference efficiency. GUARD provides a principled approach to enforcing strict guarantees for LLMs without compromising their generative capabilities.",

Properly designed, they could deliver personalization without industrial-scale data hoarding, return control to individuals, optimize for genuine ends rather than click-through proxies, and support autonomous attention management. Synthesizing evidence of current systems' harms with recent work on LLM-driven pipelines, we identify four key research hurdles: generating candidates without centralized data, maintaining computational efficiency, modeling preferences robustly, and defending against prompt-injection.

The construction of an Ising models using an FM is applied to black-box combinatorial optimization problems using factorization machine with quantum annealing (FMQA). It is anticipated that the optimization performance of FMQA will be enhanced through an implementation of the warm-start method. Nevertheless, the optimal initialization method for leveraging the warm-start approach in FMQA remains undetermined. Consequently, the present study compares initialization methods based on random initialization and low-rank approximation, and then identifies a suitable one for use with warm-start in FMQA through numerical experiments. Furthermore, the properties of the initialization method by the low-rank approximation for the FM are analyzed using random matrix theory, demonstrating that the approximation accuracy of the proposed method is not significantly influenced by the specific Ising model under consideration. The findings of this study will facilitate advancements of research in the field of black-box combinatorial optimization through the use of Ising machines.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in code generation. However, in the factory automation sector, particularly motion control, manual programming, alongside inefficient and unsafe debugging practices, remains prevalent. This stems from the complex interplay of mechanical and electrical systems and stringent safety requirements. Moreover, most current AI-assisted motion control programming efforts focus on PLCs, with little attention given to high-level languages and function libraries. To address these challenges, we introduce MCCoder, an LLM-powered system tailored for generating motion control code, integrated with a soft-motion controller. MCCoder improves code generation through a structured workflow that combines multitask decomposition, hybrid retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and iterative self-correction, utilizing a well-established motion library. Additionally, it integrates a 3D simulator for intuitive motion validation and logs of full motion trajectories for data verification, significantly enhancing accuracy and safety. In the absence of benchmark datasets and metrics tailored for evaluating motion control code generation, we propose MCEVAL, a dataset spanning motion tasks of varying complexity. Experiments show that MCCoder outperforms baseline models using Advanced RAG, achieving an overall performance gain of 33.09% and a 131.77% improvement on complex tasks in the MCEVAL dataset.",

Existing detection approaches often struggle to effectively identify these complex threats, construct the attack chain for defense facilitation, or resist adversarial attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose Slot, an advanced APT detection approach based on provenance graphs and graph reinforcement learning. Slot excels in uncovering multi-level hidden relationships, such as causal, contextual, and indirect connections, among system behaviors through provenance graph mining. By pioneering the integration of graph reinforcement learning, Slot dynamically adapts to new user activities and evolving attack strategies, enhancing its resilience against adversarial attacks. Additionally, Slot automatically constructs the attack chain according to detected attacks with clustering algorithms, providing precise identification of attack paths and facilitating the development of defense strategies. Evaluations with real-world datasets demonstrate Slot's outstanding accuracy, efficiency, adaptability, and robustness in APT detection, with most metrics surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, case studies conducted to assess Slot's effectiveness in supporting APT defense further establish it as a practical and reliable tool for cybersecurity protection.",

Furthermore, if the approximation order of the velocities matches that of the extra Lagrange multiplier, we achieve optimal order convergence even in the standard iso-parametric case. In this case, we also establish some new estimates for the normal $L^2$ velocity norm. In addition, we provide numerical simulations that confirm the established error bounds and also perform a comparative analysis against the penalty approach.",

Some earlier supervised methods aim to create an interpretable latent space or discover interpretable directions, which requires exploiting data labels or annotated synthesized samples for training. However, we propose using a modification of vector quantization called space-filling vector quantization (SFVQ), which quantizes the data on a piece-wise linear curve. SFVQ can capture the underlying morphological structure of the latent space, making it interpretable. We apply this technique to model the latent space of pre-trained StyleGAN2 and BigGAN networks on various datasets. Our experiments show that the SFVQ curve yields a general interpretable model of the latent space such that it determines which parts of the latent space correspond to specific generative factors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that each line of the SFVQ curve can potentially refer to an interpretable direction for applying intelligible image transformations. We also demonstrate that the points located on an SFVQ line can be used for controllable data augmentation.",

This is particularly important in 6G-enabled Internet of Things (6G-IoT) scenarios, where bandwidth constraints, latency requirements, and data privacy are critical. However, existing methods struggle to fully disentangle task-relevant and task-irrelevant information, leading to privacy concerns and suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose an information-bottleneck inspired method, named CLAD (contrastive learning and adversarial disentanglement). CLAD utilizes contrastive learning to effectively capture task-relevant features while employing adversarial disentanglement to discard task-irrelevant information. Additionally, due to the absence of reliable and reproducible methods to quantify the minimality of encoded feature vectors, we introduce the Information Retention Index (IRI), a comparative metric used as a proxy for the mutual information between the encoded features and the input. The IRI reflects how minimal and informative the representation is, making it highly relevant for privacy-preserving and bandwidth-efficient 6G-IoT systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLAD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of semantic extraction, task performance, privacy preservation, and IRI, making it a promising building block for responsible, efficient and trustworthy 6G-IoT services.",

      "abstract": "The widespread usage of the Internet of Things (IoT) has raised the risks of cyber threats, thus developing Anomaly Detection Systems (ADSs) that can adapt to evolving or new attacks is critical. Previous studies primarily focused on offline unsupervised learning methods to safeguard ADSs, which is not applicable in practical real-world applications. Besides, most of them strongly rely on assumptions of known legitimates and fail to satisfy the interpretable requirements in security applications, creating barriers to the adoption in practice. In this paper, we design Adaptive NAD, a general framework to improve and interpret online unsupervised anomaly detection in security domains. An interpretable two-layer anomaly detection strategy is proposed to generate reliable high-confidence pseudo-labels. Then, an online learning scheme is introduced to update Adaptive NAD by a novel threshold calculation technique to adapt to new threats. Experimental results demonstrate that Adaptive NAD achieves more than 5.4%, 23.0%, and 3.2% improvements in SPAUC compared with state-of-the-art solutions on the CIC-Darknet2020, CIC-DoHBrw-2020, and Edge-IIoTset datasets, respectively.

      "abstract": "Motivated by our collaboration with a major refugee resettlement agency in the U.S., we study a dynamic matching problem where each new arrival (a refugee case) must be matched immediately and irrevocably to one of the static resources (a location with a fixed annual quota). In addition to consuming the static resource, each case requires post-allocation services from a server, such as a translator. Given the uncertainty in service time, a server may not be available at a given time, thus we refer to it as a dynamic resource. Upon matching, the case will wait to avail service in a first-come-first-serve manner. Bursty matching to a location may result in undesirable congestion at its corresponding server. Consequently, the central planner (the agency) faces a dynamic matching problem with an objective that combines the matching reward (captured by pair-specific employment outcomes) with the cost for congestion for dynamic resources and over-allocation for the static ones. Motivated by the observed fluctuations in the composition of refugee pools across the years, we aim to design algorithms that do not rely on distributional knowledge. We develop learning-based algorithms that are asymptotically optimal in certain regimes, easy to interpret, and computationally fast. Our design is based on learning the dual variables of the underlying optimization problem; however, the main challenge lies in the time-varying nature of the dual variables associated with dynamic resources. Our theoretical development brings together techniques from Lyapunov analysis, adversarial online learning, and stochastic optimization. On the application side, when tested on real data from our partner agency and incorporating practical considerations, our method outperforms existing ones making it a viable candidate for replacing the current practice upon experimentation.",

      "abstract": "Despite the outstanding performance in vision-language reasoning, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) might generate hallucinated contents that do not exist in the given image. Most existing LVLM hallucination benchmarks are constrained to evaluate the object-related hallucinations. However, the potential hallucination on the relations between two objects, i.e., relation hallucination, still lacks investigation. To remedy that, we design a unified framework to measure the object and relation hallucination in LVLMs simultaneously. The core idea of our framework is to evaluate hallucinations via (object, relation, object) triplets extracted from LVLMs' responses, making it easily generalizable to different vision-language tasks. Based on our framework, we further introduce Tri-HE, a novel Triplet-level Hallucination Evaluation benchmark which can be used to study both object and relation hallucination at the same time. With comprehensive evaluations on Tri-HE, we observe that the relation hallucination issue is even more serious than object hallucination among existing LVLMs, highlighting a previously neglected problem towards reliable LVLMs. Moreover, based on our findings, we design a simple training-free approach that effectively mitigates hallucinations for LVLMs. Our dataset and code for the reproduction of our experiments are available publicly at https://github.com/wujunjie1998/Tri-HE.",

The sixth generation (6G) and beyond 6G wireless networks are expected to bridge the digital and physical worlds by providing wireless connectivity as a service to different vertical sectors, making the society increasingly dependent on wireless networks. Thus, any disruption to these networks would have a significant impact with far-reaching consequences. Disruptions can occur for a variety of reasons, including planned outages, natural disasters, and deliberate cybersecurity attacks. Resilience against such disruptions is expected to be one of the most important defining features of future wireless networks. This paper first discusses a generic framework for designing future resilient wireless networks. A novel resilient-by-design framework consisting of four building blocks, namely predict, preempt, protect and progress, is then proposed as a specific example.",

Inversion-based methods address this by reversing the denoising trajectory, mapping each image back to its approximated starting noise. In this work, we thoroughly analyze this procedure and focus on the relation between the initial Gaussian noise, the generated samples, and their corresponding latent encodings obtained through the DDIM inversion. First, we show that latents exhibit structural patterns in the form of less diverse noise predicted for smooth image regions. As a consequence of this divergence, we present that the space of image inversions is notably less manipulative than the original Gaussian noise. Next, we explain the origin of the phenomenon, demonstrating that, during the first inversion steps, the noise prediction error is much more significant for the plain areas than for the rest of the image. As a surprisingly simple solution, we propose to replace the first DDIM Inversion steps with a forward diffusion process, which successfully decorrelates latent encodings, leading to higher quality editions and interpolations.

Crucially, under a change of coordinates, the networked dynamics coincide with primal-dual dynamics associated with the constrained flow problem in edge coordinates. Next, we show that, under mild feasibility assumptions, the networked dynamics are globally asymptotically stable with respect to the set of optimizers of its associated constrained flow problem in nodal coordinates. Subsequently, we apply our stability results to establish frequency stability of power-limiting grid-forming droop control. Compared to conventional grid-forming droop control, power-limiting droop control explicitly accounts for active power limits of the generation (e.g., renewables) interfaced by the converter. While power-limiting droop control has been demonstrated to work well in simulation and experiment, analytical results are not readily available. Moreover, we (i) show that the converter frequencies synchronize to a common synchronous frequency for each grid-forming converter, (ii) characterize the synchronous frequency in the case of converters operating at their power limit, and (iii) establish that power-limiting droop control exhibits power-sharing properties similar to conventional unconstrained droop control. Finally, the analytical results are illustrated using an Electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation.",

Unlike traditional BLF methods, where control effort continuously increases as the state approaches the constraint boundaries, the p-BLF maintains minimal control effort in unconstrained regions and increases it progressively toward the boundaries. In contrast to previous methods with predefined safe zones and abrupt control activation, the p-BLF provides a smooth transition, improving continuity in the control response and enhancing stability by reducing chattering. Two forms of the p-BLF, logarithmic-based and rational-based, are developed to handle systems with either output constraints or full-state constraints. Theoretical analysis guarantees that all system states remain within the defined constraints, ensuring boundedness and stability of the closed-loop system. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in constrained nonlinear control.",

Current characterization and calibration methods (1) use simplified test specimen geometries and global data, (2) cannot guarantee that sufficient characterization data is collected for a specific model of interest, (3) use deterministic methods that provide best-fit parameter values with no uncertainty quantification, and (4) are sequential, inflexible, and time-consuming. This work brings together several recent advancements into an improved workflow called Interlaced Characterization and Calibration that advances the state-of-the-art in constitutive model calibration. The ICC paradigm (1) efficiently uses full-field data to calibrate a high-fidelity material model, (2) aligns the data needed with the data collected with an optimal experimental design protocol, (3) quantifies parameter uncertainty through Bayesian inference, and (4) incorporates these advances into a quasi real-time feedback loop. The ICC framework is demonstrated on the calibration of a material model using simulated full-field data for an aluminum cruciform specimen being deformed bi-axially. The cruciform is actively driven through the myopically optimal load path using Bayesian optimal experimental design, which selects load steps that yield the maximum expected information gain. To aid in numerical stability and preserve computational resources, the full-field data is dimensionally reduced via principal component analysis, and fast surrogate models which approximate the input-output relationships of the expensive finite element model are used. The tools demonstrated here show that high-fidelity constitutive models can be efficiently and reliably calibrated with quantified uncertainty, thus supporting credible decision-making and potentially increasing the agility of solid mechanics modeling.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), excelling in tasks like text generation and summarization. However, their increasing adoption in mission-critical applications raises concerns about hardware-based threats, particularly bit-flip attacks (BFAs). BFAs, enabled by fault injection methods such as Rowhammer, target model parameters in memory, compromising both integrity and performance. Identifying critical parameters for BFAs in the vast parameter space of LLMs poses significant challenges. While prior research suggests transformer-based architectures are inherently more robust to BFAs compared to traditional deep neural networks, we challenge this assumption. For the first time, we demonstrate that as few as three bit-flips can cause catastrophic performance degradation in an LLM with billions of parameters. Current BFA techniques are inadequate for exploiting this vulnerability due to the difficulty of efficiently identifying critical parameters within the immense parameter space. To address this, we propose AttentionBreaker, a novel framework tailored for LLMs that enables efficient traversal of the parameter space to identify critical parameters. Additionally, we introduce GenBFA, an evolutionary optimization strategy designed to refine the search further, isolating the most critical bits for an efficient and effective attack. Empirical results reveal the profound vulnerability of LLMs to AttentionBreaker. For example, merely three bit-flips (4.129 x 10^-9% of total parameters) in the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct 8-bit quantized (W8) model result in a complete performance collapse: accuracy on MMLU tasks drops from 67.3% to 0%, and Wikitext perplexity skyrockets from 12.6 to 4.72 x 10^5. These findings underscore the effectiveness of AttentionBreaker in uncovering and exploiting critical vulnerabilities within LLM architectures.",

      "abstract": "Advancements in image segmentation play an integral role within the broad scope of Deep Learning-based Computer Vision. Furthermore, their widespread applicability in critical real-world tasks has resulted in challenges related to the reliability of such algorithms. Hence, uncertainty quantification has been extensively studied within this context, enabling the expression of model ignorance (epistemic uncertainty) or data ambiguity (aleatoric uncertainty) to prevent uninformed decision-making. Due to the rapid adoption of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based segmentation models in high-stake applications, a substantial body of research has been published on this very topic, causing its swift expansion into a distinct field. This work provides a comprehensive overview of probabilistic segmentation, by discussing fundamental concepts of uncertainty quantification, governing advancements in the field as well as the application to various tasks. Moreover, literature on both types of uncertainties trace back to four key applications: (1) to quantify statistical inconsistencies in the annotation process due ambiguous images, (2) correlating prediction error with uncertainty, (3) expanding the model hypothesis space for better generalization, and (4) Active Learning. An extensive discussion follows that includes an overview of utilized datasets for each of the applications and evaluation of the available methods. We also highlight challenges related to architectures, uncertainty quantification methods, standardization and benchmarking, and finally end with recommendations for future work such as methods based on single forward passes and models that appropriately leverage volumetric data.",

      "abstract": "A widely-used technique in designing energy-efficient deep neural network (DNN) accelerators is quantization. Recent progress in this direction has reduced the bitwidths used in DNN down to 2. Meanwhile, many prior works apply approximate multipliers (AppMuls) in designing DNN accelerators to lower their energy consumption. Unfortunately, these works still assume a bitwidth much larger than 2, which falls far behind the state-of-the-art in quantization area and even challenges the meaningfulness of applying AppMuls in DNN accelerators, since a high-bitwidth AppMul consumes much more energy than a low-bitwidth exact multiplier! Thus, an important problem to study is: Can approximate multipliers be effectively applied to quantized DNN models with very low bitwidths? In this work, we give an affirmative answer to this question and present a systematic solution that achieves the answer: FAMES, a fast approximate multiplier substitution method for mixed-precision DNNs. Our experiments demonstrate an average 28.67% energy reduction on state-of-the-art mixed-precision quantized models with bitwidths as low as 2 bits and accuracy losses kept under 1%. Additionally, our approach is up to 300x faster than previous genetic algorithm-based methods.",

      "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have great potential in medical tasks, like Visual Question Answering (VQA), where they could act as interactive assistants for both patients and clinicians. Yet their robustness to distribution shifts on unseen data remains a key concern for safe deployment. Evaluating such robustness requires a controlled experimental setup that allows for systematic insights into the model's behavior. However, we demonstrate that current setups fail to offer sufficiently thorough evaluations. To address this gap, we introduce a novel framework, called \\textit{SURE-VQA}, centered around three key requirements to overcome current pitfalls and systematically analyze VLM robustness: 1) Since robustness on synthetic shifts does not necessarily translate to real-world shifts, it should be measured on real-world shifts that are inherent to the VQA data; 2) Traditional token-matching metrics often fail to capture underlying semantics, necessitating the use of large language models (LLMs) for more accurate semantic evaluation; 3) Model performance often lacks interpretability due to missing sanity baselines, thus meaningful baselines should be reported that allow assessing the multimodal impact on the VLM. To demonstrate the relevance of this framework, we conduct a study on the robustness of various Fine-Tuning (FT) methods across three medical datasets with four types of distribution shifts. Our study highlights key insights into robustness: 1) No FT method consistently outperforms others in robustness, and 2) robustness trends are more stable across FT methods than across distribution shifts. Additionally, we find that simple sanity baselines that do not use the image data can perform surprisingly well and confirm LoRA as the best-performing FT method on in-distribution data.

Providing a solution to these applications requires a multifaceted approach that covers scene-centric, object-centric, as well as interaction-centric capabilities. While there exist numerous datasets and algorithms approaching the former two problems, the task of understanding interactable and articulated objects is underrepresented and only partly covered in the research field. In this work, we address this shortcoming by introducing: (1) Articulate3D, an expertly curated 3D dataset featuring high-quality manual annotations on 280 indoor scenes. Articulate3D provides 8 types of annotations for articulated objects, covering parts and detailed motion information, all stored in a standardized scene representation format designed for scalable 3D content creation, exchange and seamless integration into simulation environments. (2) USDNet, a novel unified framework capable of simultaneously predicting part segmentation along with a full specification of motion attributes for articulated objects. We evaluate USDNet on Articulate3D as well as two existing datasets, demonstrating the advantage of our unified dense prediction approach. Furthermore, we highlight the value of Articulate3D through cross-dataset and cross-domain evaluations and showcase its applicability in downstream tasks such as scene editing through LLM prompting and robotic policy training for articulated object manipulation.

Under this rule, each voter controls a part of the budget and, in each step, the corresponding voters allocate their entire budget to the candidate approved by the largest number of voters with non-zero budget. We show that MP meets our criteria as it satisfies monotonicity and a demanding population consistency condition and gives a $2$-approximation to a fairness notion called average fair share (AFS). Moreover, we generalize MP to the class of sequential payment rule and prove that it is the most desirable rule in this class: all sequential payment rules but MP and one other rule fail monotonicity while only allowing for a small improvement in the approximation ratio to AFS.",

While much research has focused on zero-shot learning in computer vision, the application of these methods to environmental audio remains underexplored, with poor performance in existing studies. Generative methods, which have demonstrated success in computer vision, are notably absent from zero-shot environmental sound classification studies.\n  To address this gap, this work investigates generative methods for zero-shot learning in environmental audio. Two successful generative models from computer vision are adapted: a cross-aligned and distribution-aligned variational autoencoder (CADA-VAE) and a leveraging invariant side generative adversarial network (LisGAN). Additionally, we introduced a novel diffusion model conditioned on class auxiliary data. Synthetic embeddings generated by the diffusion model are combined with seen class embeddings to train a classifier.\n  Experiments are conducted on five environmental audio datasets, ESC-50, ARCA23K-FSD, FSC22, UrbanSound8k and TAU Urban Acoustics 2019, and one music classification dataset, GTZAN. Results show that the diffusion model outperforms all baseline methods on average across six audio datasets.\n  This work establishes the diffusion model as a promising approach for zero-shot learning and introduces the first benchmark of generative methods for zero-shot environmental sound classification, providing a foundation for future research.",

      "abstract": "Although recent quantized Large Language Models (LLMs), such as BitNet, have paved the way for significant reduction in memory usage during deployment with binary or ternary weights, training these models still demands substantial memory footprints. This is partly because high-precision (i.e., unquantized) weights required for straight-through estimation must be maintained throughout the whole training process. To address this, we explore directly updating the quantized low-precision weights without relying on straight-through estimation during backpropagation, aiming to save memory usage during training. Specifically, we employ a stochastic rounding technique to minimize the information loss caused by the use of low-bit weights throughout training. Experimental results on our LLaMA-structured models of various sizes indicate that (1) training with only low-precision weights is feasible even when they are constrained to ternary values; (2) extending the bit width to 8 bits achieves performance on par with BitNet b1.58; (3) our models remain robust to precision scaling and memory reduction, showing minimal performance degradation when moving from FP32 to lower-memory environments (BF16/FP8); and (4) our models also support inference using ternary weights, showcasing their flexibility in deployment.",

However, integration of LLMs raises valid questions on their reliability and trustworthiness, given their propensity to generate hallucinations: plausible, factually-incorrect responses, which are expressed with striking confidence. Previous work has shown that hallucinations and other non-factual responses generated by LLMs can be detected by examining the uncertainty of the LLM in its response to the pertinent prompt, driving significant research efforts devoted to quantifying the uncertainty of LLMs. This survey seeks to provide an extensive review of existing uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs, identifying their salient features, along with their strengths and weaknesses. We present existing methods within a relevant taxonomy, unifying ostensibly disparate methods to aid understanding of the state of the art. Furthermore, we highlight applications of uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs, spanning chatbot and textual applications to embodied artificial intelligence applications in robotics. We conclude with open research challenges in uncertainty quantification of LLMs, seeking to motivate future research.",

      "abstract": "The modern paradigm in machine learning involves pre-training on diverse data, followed by task-specific fine-tuning. In reinforcement learning (RL), this translates to learning via offline RL on a diverse historical dataset, followed by rapid online RL fine-tuning using interaction data. Most RL fine-tuning methods require continued training on offline data for stability and performance. However, this is undesirable because training on diverse offline data is slow and expensive for large datasets, and in principle, also limit the performance improvement possible because of constraints or pessimism on offline data. In this paper, we show that retaining offline data is unnecessary as long as we use a properly-designed online RL approach for fine-tuning offline RL initializations. To build this approach, we start by analyzing the role of retaining offline data in online fine-tuning. We find that continued training on offline data is mostly useful for preventing a sudden divergence in the value function at the onset of fine-tuning, caused by a distribution mismatch between the offline data and online rollouts. This divergence typically results in unlearning and forgetting the benefits of offline pre-training. Our approach, Warm-start RL (WSRL), mitigates the catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained initializations using a very simple idea. WSRL employs a warmup phase that seeds the online RL run with a very small number of rollouts from the pre-trained policy to do fast online RL. The data collected during warmup helps ``recalibrate'' the offline Q-function to the online distribution, allowing us to completely discard offline data without destabilizing the online RL fine-tuning. We show that WSRL is able to fine-tune without retaining any offline data, and is able to learn faster and attains higher performance than existing algorithms irrespective of whether they retain offline data or not.",

      "abstract": "Textual-based prompt learning methods primarily employ multiple learnable soft prompts and hard class tokens in a cascading manner as text inputs, aiming to align image and text (category) spaces for downstream tasks. However, current training is restricted to aligning images with predefined known categories and cannot be associated with unknown categories. In this work, we propose utilizing universal attributes as a bridge to enhance the alignment between images and unknown categories. Specifically, we introduce an Attribute-anchored Textual Prompt learning method for vision-language models, named ATPrompt. This approach expands the learning space of soft prompts from the original one-dimensional category level into the multi-dimensional attribute level by incorporating multiple attribute tokens into the learnable soft prompts. Through this modification, we transform the text prompt from a category-centric form to an attribute-category hybrid form. Additionally, we introduce a straightforward differentiable attribute search method to identify representative and suitable attributes for downstream tasks. As an easy-to-use plug-in technique, ATPrompt can seamlessly replace the existing basic prompt format in textual-based methods, providing general improvements at a negligible computational cost. Extensive experiments across 11 datasets validate the effectiveness of our method. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhengli97/ATPrompt.",

However, current CBMs typically rely on concept sets extracted from large language models or extensive image corpora, limiting their effectiveness in data-sparse scenarios. We propose Data-efficient CBMs (DCBMs), which reduce the need for large sample sizes during concept generation while preserving interpretability. DCBMs define concepts as image regions detected by segmentation or detection foundation models, allowing each image to generate multiple concepts across different granularities. This removes reliance on textual descriptions and large-scale pre-training, making DCBMs applicable for fine-grained classification and out-of-distribution tasks. Attribution analysis using Grad-CAM demonstrates that DCBMs deliver visual concepts that can be localized in test images. By leveraging dataset-specific concepts instead of predefined ones, DCBMs enhance adaptability to new domains.",

      "abstract": "Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are crucial for safeguarding digital infrastructure. In dynamic network environments, both threat landscapes and normal operational behaviors are constantly changing, resulting in concept drift. While continuous learning mitigates the adverse effects of concept drift, insufficient attention to drift patterns and excessive preservation of outdated knowledge can still hinder the IDS's adaptability. In this paper, we propose SSF (Strategic Selection and Forgetting), a novel continual learning method for IDS, providing continuous model updates with a constantly refreshed memory buffer. Our approach features a strategic sample selection algorithm to select representative new samples and a strategic forgetting mechanism to drop outdated samples. The proposed strategic sample selection algorithm prioritizes new samples that cause the `drifted' pattern, enabling the model to better understand the evolving landscape. Additionally, we introduce strategic forgetting upon detecting significant drift by discarding outdated samples to free up memory, allowing the incorporation of more recent data. SSF captures evolving patterns effectively and ensures the model is aligned with the change of data patterns, significantly enhancing the IDS's adaptability to concept drift. The state-of-the-art performance of SSF on NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets demonstrates its superior adaptability to concept drift for network intrusion detection.

      "abstract": "Data-free quantization (DFQ) enables model quantization without accessing real data, addressing concerns regarding data security and privacy. With the growing adoption of Vision Transformers (ViTs), DFQ for ViTs has garnered significant attention. However, existing DFQ methods exhibit two limitations: (1) semantic distortion, where the semantics of synthetic images deviate substantially from those of real images, and (2) semantic inadequacy, where synthetic images contain extensive regions with limited content and oversimplified textures, leading to suboptimal quantization performance. To address these limitations, we propose SARDFQ, a novel Semantics Alignment and Reinforcement Data-Free Quantization method for ViTs. To address semantic distortion, SARDFQ incorporates Attention Priors Alignment (APA), which optimizes synthetic images to follow randomly generated structure attention priors. To mitigate semantic inadequacy, SARDFQ introduces Multi-Semantic Reinforcement (MSR), leveraging localized patch optimization to enhance semantic richness across synthetic images. Furthermore, SARDFQ employs Soft-Label Learning (SL), wherein multiple semantic targets are adapted to facilitate the learning of multi-semantic images augmented by MSR. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SARDFQ, significantly surpassing existing methods. For example, SARDFQ improves top-1 accuracy on ImageNet by 15.52% for W4A4 ViT-B.

To better prevent regressions in cloud platforms, the design of pre-production testing environments (that test new agents, new hardwares, and other changes) must take into account the diversity of server/node properties (hardware model, virtual machine type, etc.) across the fleet and dynamically emphasize or de-emphasize the prevalence of certain node properties based on current testing priorities. This paper formulates this task as the ``environment design\" problem and presents the EnvDesign model, a method that uses graph theory and optimization algorithms to solve the environment design problem. The EnvDesign model was built on context and techniques that apply to combinatorial testing in general, so it can support combinatorial testing in other domains.

      "abstract": "We investigate the use of transformer-based language models, RoBERTa, T5, and LLaMA, for predicting the band gaps of semiconductor materials directly from textual representations that encode key material features such as chemical composition, crystal system, space group, number of atoms per unit cell, valence electron count, and other relevant electronic and structural properties. Quantum chemistry simulations such as DFT provide accurate predictions but are computationally intensive, limiting their feasibility for large-scale materials screening. Shallow ML models offer faster alternatives but typically require extensive data preprocessing to convert non-numerical material features into structured numerical inputs, often at the cost of losing critical descriptive information. In contrast, our approach leverages pretrained language models to process textual data directly, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering. We construct material descriptions in two formats: structured strings that combine key features in a consistent template, and natural language narratives generated using the ChatGPT API. For each model, we append a custom regression head and perform task-specific finetuning on a curated dataset of inorganic compounds. Our results show that finetuned language models, particularly the decoder-only LLaMA-3 architecture, can outperform conventional approaches in prediction accuracy and flexibility, achieving an MAE of 0.25 eV and R2 of 0.89, compared to the best shallow ML baseline, which achieved an MAE of 0.32 eV and R2 of 0.84. Notably, LLaMA-3 achieves competitive accuracy with minimal finetuning, suggesting its architecture enables more transferable representations for scientific tasks. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of finetuned language models for scientific property prediction and provides a scalable, language-native framework for materials informatics.",

Specifically, we propose a decoupling fusion module that decouples the information from the different modalities into related and unrelated information, thereby achieving a more delicate fusion. And we fuse temporal embryo images with a spatial-temporal position encoding, and extract fertility table indicator information with a table transformer. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we use a new dataset including 4046 cases collected from Southern Medical University.

      "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in chart understanding tasks. However, interpreting charts with textual descriptions often leads to information loss, as it fails to fully capture the dense information embedded in charts. In contrast, parsing charts into code provides lossless representations that can effectively contain all critical details. Although existing open-source MLLMs have achieved success in chart understanding tasks, they still face two major challenges when applied to chart-to-code tasks: (1) Low executability and poor restoration of chart details in the generated code and (2) Lack of large-scale and diverse training data. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{ChartCoder}, the first dedicated chart-to-code MLLM, which leverages Code LLMs as the language backbone to enhance the executability of the generated code. Furthermore, we introduce \\textbf{Chart2Code-160k}, the first large-scale and diverse dataset for chart-to-code generation, and propose the \\textbf{Snippet-of-Thought (SoT)} method, which transforms direct chart-to-code generation data into step-by-step generation. Experiments demonstrate that ChartCoder, with only 7B parameters, surpasses existing open-source MLLMs on chart-to-code benchmarks, achieving superior chart restoration and code excitability.

      "abstract": "Significant progress has been made in the field of video question answering (VideoQA) thanks to deep learning and large-scale pretraining. Despite the presence of sophisticated model structures and powerful video-text foundation models, most existing methods focus solely on maximizing the correlation between answers and video-question pairs during training. We argue that these models often establish shortcuts, resulting in spurious correlations between questions and answers, especially when the alignment between video and text data is suboptimal. To address these spurious correlations, we propose a novel training framework in which the model is compelled to acknowledge its ignorance when presented with an intervened question, rather than making guesses solely based on superficial question-answer correlations. We introduce methodologies for intervening in questions, utilizing techniques such as displacement and perturbation, and design frameworks for the model to admit its lack of knowledge in both multi-choice VideoQA and open-ended settings. In practice, we integrate a state-of-the-art model into our framework to validate its effectiveness. The results clearly demonstrate that our framework can significantly enhance the performance of VideoQA models with minimal structural modifications.",

      "abstract": "In MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games), abnormal players (bots) using unauthorized automated programs to carry out pre-defined behaviors systematically and repeatedly are commonly observed. Bots usually engage in these activities to gain in-game money, which they eventually trade for real money outside the game. Such abusive activities negatively impact the in-game experiences of legitimate users since bots monopolize specific hunting areas and obtain valuable items. Thus, detecting abnormal players is a significant task for game companies. Motivated by the fact that bots tend to behave collectively with similar in-game trajectories due to the auto-programs, we developed BotTRep, a framework that comprises trajectory representation learning followed by clustering using a completely unlabeled in-game trajectory dataset. Our model aims to learn representations for in-game trajectory sequences so that players with contextually similar trajectories have closer embeddings. Then, by applying DBSCAN to these representations and visualizing the corresponding moving patterns, our framework ultimately assists game masters in identifying and banning bots.",

      "abstract": "We propose, implement, and evaluate NxBFT, a resilient and efficient State Machine Replication protocol using Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). NxBFT focuses on a \"Not eXactly Byzantine\" (NxB) operating model as a middle ground between crash and Byzantine fault tolerance. NxBFT's consensus layer is asynchronous, graph-based, leaderless, and optimized for the NxB operating model, enabling load-balancing of requests between replicas and, in fault-free cases, two network round trips between decisions. We identify fundamental issues with crash recovery due the use of TEEs in asynchrony that only can be circumvented by relying on synchrony for liveness. We provide a throughput-latency trade-off analysis of NxBFT, Chained-Damysus (rotating leader), and MinBFT (static leader) for up to 40 replicas and network round trip latencies up to 150 ms. NxBFT achieves the highest throughput in all scenarios. When small latencies are required, MinBFT and Damysus are at an advantage with Damysus benefiting from the NxB model in terms of throughput for small deployments. In contrast to leader-based approaches, NxBFT's performance is almost not impacted when actual crash faults occur.",

However, the widespread deployment of air quality monitoring stations is constrained by their significant costs. To address this limitation, we introduce \\emph{AirRadar}, a deep neural network designed to accurately infer real-time air quality in locations lacking monitoring stations by utilizing data from existing ones. By leveraging learnable mask tokens, AirRadar reconstructs air quality features in unmonitored regions. Specifically, it operates in two stages: first capturing spatial correlations and then adjusting for distribution shifts. We validate AirRadar's efficacy using a year-long dataset from 1,085 monitoring stations across China, demonstrating its superiority over multiple baselines, even with varying degrees of unobserved data.

      "abstract": "Real-world tasks such as garment manipulation and table rearrangement demand robots to perform generalizable, highly precise, and long-horizon actions. Although imitation learning has proven to be an effective approach for teaching robots new skills, large amounts of expert demonstration data are still indispensible for these complex tasks, resulting in high sample complexity and costly data collection. To address this, we propose Semantic Keypoint Imitation Learning (SKIL), a framework which automatically obtains semantic keypoints with the help of vision foundation models, and forms the descriptor of semantic keypoints that enables efficient imitation learning of complex robotic tasks with significantly lower sample complexity. In real-world experiments, SKIL doubles the performance of baseline methods in tasks such as picking a cup or mouse, while demonstrating exceptional robustness to variations in objects, environmental changes, and distractors. For long-horizon tasks like hanging a towel on a rack where previous methods fail completely, SKIL achieves a mean success rate of 70\\% with as few as 30 demonstrations. Furthermore, SKIL naturally supports cross-embodiment learning due to its semantic keypoints abstraction. Our experiments demonstrate that even human videos bring considerable improvement to the learning performance. All these results demonstrate the great success of SKIL in achieving data-efficient generalizable robotic learning.

The method then produces a vertex embedding by retaining only the dimensions corresponding to these principal communities. Theoretically, we define the population version of the encoder embedding and the community score based on a random Bernoulli graph distribution. We prove that the population principal graph encoder embedding preserves the conditional density of the vertex labels and that the population community score successfully distinguishes the principal communities.

These methods yield a semi-discrete entropy inequality, and rely on an algebraic flux differencing formulation which involves both summation-by-parts (SBP) discretization matrices and entropy conservative two-point finite volume fluxes. However, explicit expressions for such two-point finite volume fluxes may not be available for all systems, or may be computationally expensive to compute.\n  This paper proposes an alternative approach to constructing entropy stable DG methods using an entropy correction artificial viscosity, where the artificial viscosity coefficient is determined based on the local violation of a cell entropy inequality and the local entropy dissipation. The resulting method is a modification of the entropy correction introduced by Abgrall, Offner, and Ranocha (2022) in \"Reinterpretation and Extension of Entropy Correction Terms for Residual Distribution and Discontinuous Galerkin Schemes: Application to Structure Preserving Discretization\", and recovers the same global semi-discrete entropy inequality that is satisfied by entropy stable flux differencing DG methods. The entropy correction artificial viscosity coefficients are parameter-free and locally computable over each cell, and the resulting artificial viscosity preserves both high order accuracy and a hyperbolic maximum stable time-step size under explicit time-stepping.",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel problem, distributional information embedding, motivated by the practical demands of multi-bit watermarking for large language models (LLMs). Unlike traditional information embedding, which embeds information into a pre-existing host signal, LLM watermarking actively controls the text generation process--adjusting the token distribution--to embed a detectable signal. We develop an information-theoretic framework to analyze this distributional information embedding problem, characterizing the fundamental trade-offs among three critical performance metrics: text quality, detectability, and information rate. In the asymptotic regime, we demonstrate that the maximum achievable rate with vanishing error corresponds to the entropy of the LLM's output distribution and increases with higher allowable distortion. We also characterize the optimal watermarking scheme to achieve this rate. Extending the analysis to the finite-token case with non-i.i.d. tokens, we identify schemes that maximize detection probability while adhering to constraints on false alarm and distortion.",

      "abstract": "In many blockchains, e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), the primary representation used for wallet addresses is a hardly memorable 40-digit hexadecimal string. As a result, users often select addresses from their recent transaction history, which enables blockchain address poisoning. The adversary first generates lookalike addresses similar to one with which the victim has previously interacted, and then engages with the victim to ``poison'' their transaction history. The goal is to have the victim mistakenly send tokens to the lookalike address, as opposed to the intended recipient. Compared to contemporary studies, this paper provides four notable contributions. First, we develop a detection system and perform measurements over two years on both Ethereum and BSC. We identify 13~times more attack attempts than reported previously -- totaling 270M on-chain attacks targeting 17M victims. 6,633 incidents have caused at least 83.8M USD in losses, which makes blockchain address poisoning one of the largest cryptocurrency phishing schemes observed in the wild. Second, we analyze a few large attack entities using improved clustering techniques, and model attacker profitability and competition. Third, we reveal attack strategies -- targeted populations, success conditions (address similarity, timing), and cross-chain attacks. Fourth, we mathematically define and simulate the lookalike address generation process across various software- and hardware-based implementations, and identify a large-scale attacker group that appears to use GPUs. We also discuss defensive countermeasures.",

Our research proposes \"Beyond-Labels\", a lightweight transformer-based fusion module that uses a small amount of image segmentation data to fuse frozen visual representations with language concepts. This strategy allows the model to leverage the extensive knowledge of pre-trained models without requiring significant retraining, making the approach data-efficient and scalable. Furthermore, we capture positional information in images using Fourier embeddings, improving generalization and enabling smooth and consistent spatial encoding. We perform thorough ablation studies to examine the main components of our proposed method.

Specifically, we assume that we can detect when a node is transmitting, but no further information regarding the transmission is available. We propose a novel network estimation procedure grounded in the following abstract problem: estimating the parameters of a finite discrete-time Markov chain by observing, at each time step, which states are visited by multiple ``anonymous'' copies of the chain. We develop a consistent estimator that approximates the transition matrix of the chain in the operator norm, with the number of required samples scaling roughly linearly with the size of the state space. Applying this estimation procedure to wireless networks, our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method accurately infers network topology across a wide range of parameters, consistently outperforming transfer entropy, particularly under conditions of high network congestion.",

Specifically, we demonstrate that, ignoring the logarithmic factors, for an $n$-dimensional LTI system with no external inputs, the estimation error of these matrices decreases at a rate of at least $ \\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{1/N}) $, while the estimation error of the system poles decays at a rate of at least $ \\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2n}) $, where $ N $ represents the number of sample trajectories.

      "abstract": "The impact of communication on decision-making systems has been extensively studied under the assumption of dedicated communication channels. We instead consider communicating through actions, where the message is embedded into the actions of an agent which interacts with the environment in a Markov decision process (MDP) framework. We conceptualize the MDP environment as a finite-state channel (FSC), where the actions of the agent serve as the channel input, while the states of the MDP observed by another agent (i.e., receiver) serve as the channel output. Here, we treat the environment as a communication channel over which the agent communicates through its actions, while at the same time, trying to maximize its reward. We first characterize the optimal information theoretic trade-off between the average reward and the rate of reliable communication in the infinite-horizon regime. Then, we propose a novel framework to design a joint control/coding policy, termed \\textit{Act2Comm}, which seamlessly embeds messages into actions. From a communication perspective, \\textit{Act2Comm} functions as a learning-based channel coding scheme for non-differentiable FSCs under input-output constraints. From a control standpoint, \\textit{Act2Comm} learns an MDP policy that incorporates communication capabilities, though at the cost of some control performance. Overall, \\textit{Act2Comm} effectively balances the dual objectives of control and communication in this environment. Experimental results validate \\textit{Act2Comm}'s capability to enable reliable communication while maintaining a certain level of control performance.",

We introduce ConceptAttention, a novel method that leverages the expressive power of DiT attention layers to generate high-quality saliency maps that precisely locate textual concepts within images. Without requiring additional training, ConceptAttention repurposes the parameters of DiT attention layers to produce highly contextualized concept embeddings, contributing the major discovery that performing linear projections in the output space of DiT attention layers yields significantly sharper saliency maps compared to commonly used cross-attention maps. ConceptAttention even achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot image segmentation benchmarks, outperforming 15 other zero-shot interpretability methods on the ImageNet-Segmentation dataset. ConceptAttention works for popular image models and even seamlessly generalizes to video generation. Our work contributes the first evidence that the representations of multi-modal DiTs are highly transferable to vision tasks like segmentation.",

      "abstract": "Randomised algorithms often employ methods that can fail and that are retried with independent randomness until they succeed. Randomised data structures therefore often store indices of successful attempts, called seeds. If $n$ such seeds are required (e.g., for independent substructures) the standard approach is to compute for each $i \\in [n]$ the smallest successful seed $S_i$ and store $\\vec{S} = (S_1, \\ldots, S_n)$.\n  The central observation of this paper is that this is not space-optimal. We present a different algorithm that computes a sequence $\\vec{S}' = (S_1', \\ldots, S_n')$ of successful seeds such that the entropy of $\\vec{S'}$ undercuts the entropy of $\\vec{S}$ by $\\Omega(n)$ bits in most cases. To achieve a memory consumption of $\\mathrm{OPT}+\\varepsilon n$, the expected number of inspected seeds increases by a factor of $O(1/\\varepsilon)$.\n  We demonstrate the usefulness of our findings with a novel construction for minimal perfect hash functions that, for $n$ keys and any $\\varepsilon \\in [n^{-3/7}, 1]$, has space requirement $(1+\\varepsilon)\\mathrm{OPT}$ and construction time $O(n/\\varepsilon)$. All previous approaches only support $\\varepsilon = \\omega(1 / \\log n)$ or have construction times that increase exponentially with $1/\\varepsilon$. Our implementation beats the construction throughput of the state of the art by more than two orders of magnitude for $\\varepsilon \\leq 3\\%$.",

      "abstract": "Solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) and associated PDE-based, inverse problems is a central task in engineering and physics, yet existing neural operator methods struggle with high-dimensional, discontinuous inputs and require large amounts of {\\em labeled} training data. We propose the Deep Generative Neural Operator (DGenNO), a physics-aware framework that addresses these challenges by leveraging a deep, generative, probabilistic model in combination with a set of lower-dimensional, latent variables that simultaneously encode PDE-inputs and PDE-outputs. This formulation can make use of unlabeled data and significantly improves inverse problem-solving, particularly for discontinuous or discrete-valued input functions. DGenNO enforces physics constraints without labeled data by incorporating as virtual observables, weak-form residuals based on compactly supported radial basis functions (CSRBFs). These relax regularity constraints and eliminate higher-order derivatives from the objective function. We also introduce MultiONet, a novel neural operator architecture, which is a more expressive generalization of the popular DeepONet that significantly enhances the approximating power of the proposed model. These innovations make DGenNO particularly effective for challenging forward and inverse, PDE-based problems, such as those involving multi-phase media. Numerical experiments demonstrate that DGenNO achieves higher accuracy across multiple benchmarks while exhibiting robustness to noise and strong generalization to out-of-distribution cases. Its adaptability, and the ability to handle sparse, noisy data while providing probabilistic estimates, make DGenNO a powerful tool for scientific and engineering applications.",

In this setup, a convolutional neural network (CNN) extracts feature representations from the input image, which then guide the decoder in a sequence-to-sequence caption generation process. Although much research has focused on refining the decoder, the quality of image representations from the encoder remains crucial for accurate captioning. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates features from two distinct CNN based encoders, capturing complementary information to enhance caption generation. Additionally, we propose a weighted averaging technique to combine the outputs of all GRUs in the stacked decoder. Furthermore, a comparison-based beam search strategy is incorporated to refine caption selection. The results demonstrate that our fusion-based approach, along with the enhanced stacked decoder, significantly outperforms both the transformer-based state-of-the-art model and other LSTM-based baselines.",

Although current tracking methods have made significant advancements in accuracy and efficiency, they still face challenges in robustness when dealing with cluttered backgrounds, rotationally symmetric objects, and noisy sequences. In this paper, we first propose a robust contour-based pose tracking method that addresses error-prone contour correspondences and improves noise tolerance. It utilizes a fan-shaped search strategy to refine correspondences and models local contour shape and noise uncertainty as mixed probability distribution, resulting in a highly robust contour energy function. Secondly, we introduce a CPU-only strategy to better track rotationally symmetric objects and assist the contour-based method in overcoming local minima by exploring sparse interior correspondences. This is achieved by pre-sampling interior points from sparse viewpoint templates offline and using the DIS optical flow algorithm to compute their correspondences during tracking. Finally, we formulate a unified energy function to fuse contour and interior information, which is solvable using a re-weighted least squares algorithm. Experiments on public datasets and real scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art monocular tracking methods and can achieve more than 100 FPS using only a CPU.",

To address this, we introduce \\textbf{VLM2-Bench}, a benchmark designed to assess whether VLMs can Visually Link Matching cues, with 9 subtasks and over 3,000 test cases. Comprehensive evaluation across twelve VLMs, along with further analysis of various language-side and vision-side prompting methods, leads to a total of eight key findings. We identify critical challenges in models' ability to link visual cues, highlighting a significant performance gap. Based on these insights, we advocate for (i) enhancing core visual capabilities to improve adaptability and reduce reliance on prior knowledge, (ii) establishing clearer principles for integrating language-based reasoning in vision-centric tasks to prevent unnecessary biases, and (iii) shifting vision-text training paradigms toward fostering models' ability to independently structure and infer relationships among visual cues.",

However, these documents come in a diversity of types with differing formats and visual layouts that pose a challenge when attempting to extract and faithfully represent the underlying content for language model use. Traditional open source tools often produce lower quality extractions compared to vision language models (VLMs), but reliance on the best VLMs can be prohibitively costly (e.g., over 6,240 USD per million PDF pages for GPT-4o) or infeasible if the PDFs cannot be sent to proprietary APIs. We present olmOCR, an open-source toolkit for processing PDFs into clean, linearized plain text in natural reading order while preserving structured content like sections, tables, lists, equations, and more. Our toolkit runs a fine-tuned 7B vision language model (VLM) trained on olmOCR-mix-0225, a sample of 260,000 pages from over 100,000 crawled PDFs with diverse properties, including graphics, handwritten text and poor quality scans. olmOCR is optimized for large-scale batch processing, able to scale flexibly to different hardware setups and can convert a million PDF pages for only 176 USD. To aid comparison with existing systems, we also introduce olmOCR-Bench, a curated set of 1,400 PDFs capturing many content types that remain challenging even for the best tools and VLMs, including formulas, tables, tiny fonts, old scans, and more. We find olmOCR outperforms even top VLMs including GPT-4o, Gemini Flash 2 and Qwen-2.5-VL. We openly release all components of olmOCR: our fine-tuned VLM model, training code and data, an efficient inference pipeline that supports vLLM and SGLang backends, and benchmark olmOCR-Bench.",

Detecting LLM-generated text is crucial for upholding academic integrity, preventing plagiarism, protecting copyrights, and ensuring ethical research practices. Most prior studies on detecting LLM-generated text focus primarily on English text. However, languages with distinct morphological and syntactic characteristics require specialized detection approaches. Their unique structures and usage patterns can hinder the direct application of methods primarily designed for English. Among such languages, we focus on Korean, which has relatively flexible spacing rules, a rich morphological system, and less frequent comma usage compared to English. We introduce KatFish, the first benchmark dataset for detecting LLM-generated Korean text. The dataset consists of text written by humans and generated by four LLMs across three genres.\n  By examining spacing patterns, part-of-speech diversity, and comma usage, we illuminate the linguistic differences between human-written and LLM-generated Korean text. Building on these observations, we propose KatFishNet, a detection method specifically designed for the Korean language. KatFishNet achieves an average of 19.78% higher AUROC compared to the best-performing existing detection method. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Shinwoo-Park/detecting_llm_generated_korean_text_through_linguistic_analysis.",

These problems are often nuanced, their optimal solutions might not be efficiently obtainable, and they may require lots of time and compute resources to solve (they are NP-hard). It follows that the best course of action for solving these problems is to use general optimization algorithm paradigms to quickly and easily develop algorithms that are customized to these problems and can produce good solutions in a reasonable amount of time. In this paper, we present optimizn, a Python library for developing customized optimization algorithms under general optimization algorithm paradigms (simulated annealing, branch and bound). Additionally, optimizn offers continuous training, with which users can run their algorithms on a regular cadence, retain the salient aspects of previous runs, and use them in subsequent runs to potentially produce solutions that get closer and closer to optimality.

      "abstract": "This paper presents an algorithm to improve state estimation for legged robots. Among existing model-based state estimation methods for legged robots, the contact-aided invariant extended Kalman filter defines the state on a Lie group to preserve invariance, thereby significantly accelerating convergence. It achieves more accurate state estimation by leveraging contact information as measurements for the update step. However, when the model exhibits strong nonlinearity, the estimation accuracy decreases. Such nonlinearities can cause initial errors to accumulate and lead to large drifts over time. To address this issue, we propose compensating for errors by augmenting the Kalman filter with an artificial neural network serving as a nonlinear function approximator. Furthermore, we design this neural network to respect the Lie group structure to ensure invariance, resulting in our proposed Invariant Neural-Augmented Kalman Filter (InNKF). The proposed algorithm offers improved state estimation performance by combining the strengths of model-based and learning-based approaches.

      "abstract": "While internet-scale image and textual data have enabled strong generalization in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the absence of internet-scale control data has impeded the development of similar generalization in standard reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Although VLMs are fundamentally limited in their ability to solve control tasks due to their lack of action-conditioned training data, their capacity for image understanding allows them to provide valuable feedback in RL tasks by recognizing successful outcomes. A key challenge in Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) is determining how best to integrate VLM-derived signals into the learning process. We explore this question in the context of offline RL and introduce a class of methods called sub-trajectory filtered optimization. We identify three key insights. First, trajectory length plays a crucial role in offline RL, as full-trajectory preference learning exacerbates the stitching problem, necessitating the use of sub-trajectories. Second, even in Markovian environments, a non-Markovian reward signal from a sequence of images is required to assess trajectory improvement, as VLMs do not interpret control actions and must rely on visual cues over time. Third, a simple yet effective approach--filtered and weighted behavior cloning--consistently outperforms more complex reinforcement learning from human feedback-based methods. We propose sub-trajectory filtered behavior cloning, a method that leverages VLM feedback on sub-trajectories while incorporating a retrospective filtering mechanism that removes sub-trajectories preceding failures to improve robustness and prevent turbulence. This study is preliminary; we provide initial evidence through evaluations on a toy control domain. Please enjoy our airport puns.",

      "abstract": "Previous studies that have formulated multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for adaptive traffic signal control have primarily used value-based RL methods. However, recent literature has shown that policy-based methods may perform better in partially observable environments. Additionally, RL methods remain largely untested for real-world normally signal timing plans because of the simplifying assumptions common in the literature. The current study attempts to address these gaps and formulates a multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MA-PPO) algorithm to implement adaptive and coordinated traffic control along an arterial corridor. The formulated MA-PPO has a centralized-critic architecture under a centralized training and decentralized execution framework. Agents are designed to allow selection and implementation of up to eight signal phases, as commonly implemented in field controllers. The formulated algorithm is tested on a simulated real-world seven intersection corridor. The speed of convergence for each agent was found to depend on the size of the action space, which depends on the number and sequence of signal phases. The performance of the formulated MA-PPO adaptive control algorithm is compared with the field implemented actuated-coordinated signal control (ASC), modeled using PTV-Vissim-MaxTime software in the loop simulation (SILs). The trained MA-PPO performed significantly better than the ASC for all movements. Compared to ASC the MA-PPO showed 2% and 24% improvements in travel time in the primary and secondary coordination directions, respectively. For cross streets movements MA-PPO also showed significant crossing time reductions. Volume sensitivity experiments revealed that the formulated MA-PPO demonstrated good stability, robustness, and adaptability to changes in traffic demand.",

To address this problem, this paper proposes a vision-based framework for precisely estimating and controlling the relative position between a handheld tool and a target object for humanoid robots, e.g., a screwdriver tip and a screw head slot. By fusing images from the head and torso cameras on a robot with its head joint angles, the proposed Transformer-based visual servoing method can correct the handheld tool's positional errors effectively, especially at a close distance. Experiments on M4-M8 screws demonstrate an average convergence error of 0.8-1.3 mm and a success rate of 93\\%-100\\%. Through comparative analysis, the results validate that this capability of high-precision tiny object alignment is enabled by the Distance Estimation Transformer architecture and the Multi-Perception-Head mechanism proposed in this paper.",

      "abstract": "Indexing data is a fundamental problem in computer science. Recently, various papers apply machine learning to this problem.\n  For a fixed integer $\\varepsilon$, a \\emph{learned index} is a function $h : \\mathcal{U} \\rightarrow [0, n]$ where $\\forall q \\in \\mathcal{U}$, $h(q) \\in [\\text{rank}(q) - \\varepsilon, \\text{rank}(q) + \\varepsilon]$. These works use machine learning to compute $h$. Then, they store $S$ in a sorted array $A$ and access $A[\\lfloor h(q) \\rfloor]$ to answer queries in $O(k + \\varepsilon + \\log |h|)$ time. Here, $k$ denotes the output size and $|h|$ the complexity of $h$. Ferragina and Vinciguerra (VLDB 2020) observe that creating a learned index is a geometric problem. They define the PGM index by restricting $h$ to a piecewise linear function and show a linear-time algorithm to compute a PGM index of approximate minimum complexity.\n  Since indexing queries are decomposable, the PGM index may be made dynamic through the logarithmic method. When allowing deletions, range query times deteriorate to worst-case $O(N + \\sum\\limits_i^{\\lceil \\log n \\rceil } (\\varepsilon + \\log |h_i|))$ time (where $N$ is the largest size of $S$ seen so far).\n  This paper offers a combination of theoretical insights and experiments as we apply techniques from computational geometry to dynamically maintain an approximately minimum-complexity learned index $h : \\mathcal{U} \\rightarrow [0, n]$ with $O(\\log^2 n)$ update time.\n  We also prove that if we restrict $h$ to lie in a specific subclass of piecewise-linear functions, then we can combine $h$ and hash maps to support queries in $O(k + \\varepsilon + \\log |h|)$ time (at the cost of increasing $|h|$). We implement our algorithm and compare it to the existing implementation. Our empirical analysis shows that our solution supports more efficient range queries in the special case where the update sequence contains many deletions.",

      "abstract": "When interacting with objects, humans effectively reason about which regions of objects are viable for an intended action, i.e., the affordance regions of the object. They can also account for subtle differences in object regions based on the task to be performed and whether one or two hands need to be used. However, current vision-based affordance prediction methods often reduce the problem to naive object part segmentation. In this work, we propose a framework for extracting affordance data from human activity video datasets. Our extracted 2HANDS dataset contains precise object affordance region segmentations and affordance class-labels as narrations of the activity performed. The data also accounts for bimanual actions, i.e., two hands co-ordinating and interacting with one or more objects. We present a VLM-based affordance prediction model, 2HandedAfforder, trained on the dataset and demonstrate superior performance over baselines in affordance region segmentation for various activities. Finally, we show that our predicted affordance regions are actionable, i.e., can be used by an agent performing a task, through demonstration in robotic manipulation scenarios.

ShockHash is a technique to construct an MPHF and requires just slightly more space. It gives each key two pseudo random candidate positions. If each key can be mapped to one of its two candidate positions such that there is exactly one key mapped to each position, then an MPHF is found. If not, ShockHash repeats the process with a new set of random candidate positions. ShockHash has to store how many repetitions were required and for each key to which of the two candidate positions it is mapped. However, when a given set of candidate positions can be used as MPHF then there is not only one but multiple ways of mapping the keys to one of their candidate positions such that the mapping results in an MPHF. This redundancy makes up for the majority of the remaining space overhead in ShockHash. In this paper, we present MorphisHash which is a technique that almost completely eliminates this redundancy. Our theoretical result is that MorphisHash saves {\\Theta}(ln(n)) bits compared to ShockHash. This corresponds to a factor of 20 less space overhead in practice. The technique to accomplish this might be of a more general interest to compress data structures.",

Recent works have introduced score distillation techniques that leverage the rich generative prior of text-to-image diffusion models to solve this task without additional fine-tuning. However, these methods often struggle with tasks such as object insertion. Our investigation of these failures reveals significant variations in gradient magnitude and spatial distribution, making hyperparameter tuning highly input-specific or unsuccessful. To address this, we propose two simple yet effective modifications: attention-based spatial regularization and gradient filtering-normalization, both aimed at reducing these variations during gradient updates. Experimental results show our method outperforms state-of-the-art score distillation techniques in prompt fidelity, improving successful edits while preserving the background. Users also preferred our method over state-of-the-art techniques across three metrics, and by 58-64% overall.",

      "abstract": "Reconstructing clean, distractor-free 3D scenes from real-world captures remains a significant challenge, particularly in highly dynamic and cluttered settings such as egocentric videos. To tackle this problem, we introduce DeGauss, a simple and robust self-supervised framework for dynamic scene reconstruction based on a decoupled dynamic-static Gaussian Splatting design. DeGauss models dynamic elements with foreground Gaussians and static content with background Gaussians, using a probabilistic mask to coordinate their composition and enable independent yet complementary optimization. DeGauss generalizes robustly across a wide range of real-world scenarios, from casual image collections to long, dynamic egocentric videos, without relying on complex heuristics or extensive supervision. Experiments on benchmarks including NeRF-on-the-go, ADT, AEA, Hot3D, and EPIC-Fields demonstrate that DeGauss consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a strong baseline for generalizable, distractor-free 3D reconstructionin highly dynamic, interaction-rich environments.

By analyzing which prompts elicit which behaviors, we can categorize and compare different strategic situations, which can also help provide insight into what different economic scenarios induce people to think about. We discuss how this provides a first step towards a non-standard method of inferring (deciphering) the motivations behind the human behaviors. We also show how this deciphering process can be used to categorize differences in the behavioral tendencies of different populations.",

While proper scoring rules incentivize truthful reporting of precise forecasts, they fall short when forecasters face epistemic uncertainty about their beliefs, limiting their use in safety-critical domains where decision-makers (DMs) prioritize proper uncertainty management. To address this, we propose a framework for scoring imprecise forecasts -- forecasts given as a set of beliefs. Despite existing impossibility results for deterministic scoring rules, we enable truthful elicitation by drawing connection to social choice theory and introducing a two-way communication framework where DMs first share their aggregation rules (e.g., averaging or min-max) used in downstream decisions for resolving forecast ambiguity. This, in turn, helps forecasters resolve indecision during elicitation. We further show that truthful elicitation of imprecise forecasts is achievable using proper scoring rules randomized over the aggregation procedure. Our approach allows DM to elicit and integrate the forecaster's epistemic uncertainty into their decision-making process, thus improving credibility.",

Whilst convenient, for various MCMC algorithms this results in a synchronization problem -- loosely speaking, at each iteration all chains running in parallel must wait until the last chain has finished drawing its sample. In this work, we show how to design single-chain MCMC algorithms in a way that avoids synchronization overheads when vectorizing with tools like $\\texttt{vmap}$ by using the framework of finite state machines (FSMs). Using a simplified model, we derive an exact theoretical form of the obtainable speed-ups using our approach, and use it to make principled recommendations for optimal algorithm design. We implement several popular MCMC algorithms as FSMs, including Elliptical Slice Sampling, HMC-NUTS, and Delayed Rejection, demonstrating speed-ups of up to an order of magnitude in experiments.",

Among the methods tested, Attention Projection Layer Adaptation (APLA) sets a new state-of-the-art, consistently surpassing full-parameter SSA and supervised fine-tuning across diverse medical tasks, while reducing GPU memory by up to 40.1% and increasing training throughput by 25.2%, all while maintaining inference efficiency.",

      "abstract": "In modern medicine, clinical diagnosis relies on the comprehensive analysis of primarily textual and visual data, drawing on medical expertise to ensure systematic and rigorous reasoning. Recent advances in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and agent-based methods hold great potential for medical diagnosis, thanks to the ability to effectively integrate multi-modal patient data. However, they often provide direct answers and draw empirical-driven conclusions without quantitative analysis, which reduces their reliability and clinical usability. We propose MedAgent-Pro, a new agentic reasoning paradigm that follows the diagnosis principle in modern medicine, to decouple the process into sequential components for step-by-step, evidence-based reasoning. Our MedAgent-Pro workflow presents a hierarchical diagnostic structure to mirror this principle, consisting of disease-level standardized plan generation and patient-level personalized step-by-step reasoning. To support disease-level planning, an RAG-based agent is designed to retrieve medical guidelines to ensure alignment with clinical standards. For patient-level reasoning, we propose to integrate professional tools such as visual models to enable quantitative assessments. Meanwhile, we propose to verify the reliability of each step to achieve evidence-based diagnosis, enforcing rigorous logical reasoning and a well-founded conclusion. Extensive experiments across a wide range of anatomical regions, imaging modalities, and diseases demonstrate the superiority of MedAgent-Pro to mainstream VLMs, agentic systems and state-of-the-art expert models. Ablation studies and human evaluation by clinical experts further validate its robustness and clinical relevance. Code is available at https://github.com/jinlab-imvr/MedAgent-Pro.",

In this paper, we focus on the more challenging scenarios of article-level visual text rendering and address a novel task of generating high-quality business content, including infographics and slides, based on user provided article-level descriptive prompts and ultra-dense layouts. The fundamental challenges are twofold: significantly longer context lengths and the scarcity of high-quality business content data.\n  In contrast to most previous works that focus on a limited number of sub-regions and sentence-level prompts, ensuring precise adherence to ultra-dense layouts with tens or even hundreds of sub-regions in business content is far more challenging. We make two key technical contributions: (i) the construction of scalable, high-quality business content dataset, i.e., Infographics-650K, equipped with ultra-dense layouts and prompts by implementing a layer-wise retrieval-augmented infographic generation scheme; and (ii) a layout-guided cross attention scheme, which injects tens of region-wise prompts into a set of cropped region latent space according to the ultra-dense layouts, and refine each sub-regions flexibly during inference using a layout conditional CFG.\n  We demonstrate the strong results of our system compared to previous SOTA systems such as Flux and SD3 on our BizEval prompt set. Additionally, we conduct thorough ablation experiments to verify the effectiveness of each component. We hope our constructed Infographics-650K and BizEval can encourage the broader community to advance the progress of business content generation.",

      "abstract": "Understanding a procedural activity requires modeling both how action steps transform the scene and how evolving scene transformations can influence the sequence of action steps, even those that are accidental or erroneous. Existing work has studied procedure-aware video representations by proposing novel approaches such as modeling the temporal order of actions, and has not explicitly learned the state changes (scene transformations). In this work, we study procedure-aware video representation learning by incorporating state-change descriptions generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) as supervision signals for video encoders. Moreover, we generate state-change counterfactuals that simulate hypothesized failure outcomes, allowing models to learn by imagining the unseen ``What if'' scenarios. This counterfactual reasoning facilitates the model's ability to understand the cause and effect of each step in an activity. To verify the procedure awareness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on procedure-aware tasks, including temporal action segmentation, error detection, action phase classification, frame retrieval, multi-instance retrieval, and action recognition. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed state-change descriptions and their counterfactuals, and achieve significant improvements on multiple tasks. We will make our source code and data publicly available soon.",

      "abstract": "Magnetic soft robots embedded with hard magnetic particles enable untethered actuation via external magnetic fields, offering remote, rapid, and precise control, which is highly promising for biomedical applications. However, designing such systems is challenging due to the complex interplay of magneto-elastic dynamics, large deformation, solid contacts, time-varying stimuli, and posture-dependent loading. As a result, most existing research relies on heuristics and trial-and-error methods or focuses on the independent design of stimuli or structures under static conditions. We propose a topology optimization framework for magnetic soft robots that simultaneously designs structures, location-specific material magnetization and time-varying magnetic stimuli, accounting for large deformations, dynamic motion, and solid contacts. This is achieved by integrating generalized topology optimization with the magneto-elastic material point method, which supports GPU-accelerated parallel simulations and auto-differentiation for sensitivity analysis. We applied this framework to design magnetic robots for various tasks, including multi-task shape morphing and locomotion, in both 2D and 3D. The method autonomously generates optimized robotic systems to achieve target behaviors without requiring human intervention. Despite the nonlinear physics and large design space, it demonstrates high computational efficiency, completing all cases within minutes. The framework provides a computational foundation for the autonomous co-design of active soft materials in applications such as metasurfaces, drug delivery, and minimally invasive procedures.",

      "abstract": "In this work, we focus on scaling open-vocabulary action detection. Existing approaches for action detection are predominantly limited to closed-set scenarios and rely on complex, parameter-heavy architectures. Extending these models to the open-vocabulary setting poses two key challenges: (1) the lack of large-scale datasets with many action classes for robust training, and (2) parameter-heavy adaptations to a pretrained vision-language contrastive model to convert it for detection, risking overfitting the additional non-pretrained parameters to base action classes. Firstly, we introduce an encoder-only multimodal model for video action detection, reducing the reliance on parameter-heavy additions for video action detection. Secondly, we introduce a simple weakly supervised training strategy to exploit an existing closed-set action detection dataset for pretraining. Finally, we depart from the ill-posed base-to-novel benchmark used by prior works in open-vocabulary action detection and devise a new benchmark to evaluate on existing closed-set action detection datasets without ever using them for training, showing novel results to serve as baselines for future work.",

      "abstract": "We introduce real-is-sim, a new approach to integrating simulation into behavior cloning pipelines. In contrast to real-only methods, which lack the ability to safely test policies before deployment, and sim-to-real methods, which require complex adaptation to cross the sim-to-real gap, our framework allows policies to seamlessly switch between running on real hardware and running in parallelized virtual environments. At the center of real-is-sim is a dynamic digital twin, powered by the Embodied Gaussian simulator, that synchronizes with the real world at 60Hz. This twin acts as a mediator between the behavior cloning policy and the real robot. Policies are trained using representations derived from simulator states and always act on the simulated robot, never the real one. During deployment, the real robot simply follows the simulated robot's joint states, and the simulation is continuously corrected with real world measurements. This setup, where the simulator drives all policy execution and maintains real-time synchronization with the physical world, shifts the responsibility of crossing the sim-to-real gap to the digital twin's synchronization mechanisms, instead of the policy itself. We demonstrate real-is-sim on a long-horizon manipulation task (PushT), showing that virtual evaluations are consistent with real-world results. We further show how real-world data can be augmented with virtual rollouts and compare to policies trained on different representations derived from the simulator state including object poses and rendered images from both static and robot-mounted cameras. Our results highlight the flexibility of the real-is-sim framework across training, evaluation, and deployment stages. Videos available at https://real-is-sim.github.io.",

Such loops were shown to lead to distribution shifts - models misrepresenting the true underlying distributions of human data (also called model collapse). However, how human data properties affect such shifts remains poorly understood. In this paper, we provide the first empirical examination of the effect of such properties on the outcome of recursive training. We first confirm that using different human datasets leads to distribution shifts of different magnitudes. Through exhaustive manipulation of dataset properties combined with regression analyses, we then identify a set of properties predicting distribution shift magnitudes. Lexical diversity is found to amplify these shifts, while semantic diversity and data quality mitigate them. Furthermore, we find that these influences are highly modular: data scrapped from a given internet domain has little influence on the content generated for another domain. Finally, experiments on political bias reveal that human data properties affect whether the initial bias will be amplified or reduced. Overall, our results portray a novel view, where different parts of internet may undergo different types of distribution shift.",

Most state-of-the-art (SotA) prediction models primarily focus on forecasting the most likely future. However, for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles, it is equally important to cover the distribution for plausible motion alternatives. To address this, we introduce EP-Diffuser, a novel parameter-efficient diffusion-based generative model designed to capture the distribution of possible traffic scene evolutions. Conditioned on road layout and agent history, our model acts as a predictor and generates diverse, plausible scene continuations. We benchmark EP-Diffuser against two SotA models in terms of accuracy and plausibility of predictions on the Argoverse 2 dataset. Despite its significantly smaller model size, our approach achieves both highly accurate and plausible traffic scene predictions. We further evaluate model generalization ability in an out-of-distribution (OoD) test setting using Waymo Open dataset and show superior robustness of our approach.",

Built upon flow-based transformers, which offer stable training and continuous transformations for enhanced synchronization and audio quality, TARO introduces two key innovations: (1) Timestep-Adaptive Representation Alignment (TRA), which dynamically aligns latent representations by adjusting alignment strength based on the noise schedule, ensuring smooth evolution and improved fidelity, and (2) Onset-Aware Conditioning (OAC), which integrates onset cues that serve as sharp event-driven markers of audio-relevant visual moments to enhance synchronization with dynamic visual events. Extensive experiments on the VGGSound and Landscape datasets demonstrate that TARO outperforms prior methods, achieving relatively 53% lower Frechet Distance (FD), 29% lower Frechet Audio Distance (FAD), and a 97.19% Alignment Accuracy, highlighting its superior audio quality and synchronization precision.",

      "abstract": "Radiative backpropagation-based (RB) methods efficiently compute reverse-mode derivatives in physically-based differentiable rendering by simulating the propagation of differential radiance. A key assumption is that differential radiance is transported like normal radiance. We observe that this holds only when scene geometry is static and demonstrate that current implementations of radiative backpropagation produce biased gradients when scene parameters change geometry. In this work, we derive the differential transport equation without assuming static geometry. An immediate consequence is that the parameterization matters when the sampling process is not differentiated: only surface integrals allow a local formulation of the derivatives, i.e., one in which moving surfaces do not affect the entire path geometry. While considerable effort has been devoted to handling discontinuities resulting from moving geometry, we show that a biased interior derivative compromises even the simplest inverse rendering tasks, regardless of discontinuities. An implementation based on our derivation leads to systematic convergence to the reference solution in the same setting and provides unbiased RB interior derivatives for path-space differentiable rendering.",

However, they still fail to develop reasoning. Recently, a novel approach for developing cognitive architectures, called Synthetic Cognition, has been proposed and implemented to develop instantaneous reactive behavior. In this study, we aim to explore the use of Synthetic Cognition to develop context-aware reactive behaviors. We propose a mechanism to deal with sequences for the recent implementation of Synthetic Cognition, and test it against DNA foundation models in DNA sequence classification tasks. In our experiments, our proposal clearly outperforms the DNA foundation models, obtaining the best score on more benchmark tasks than the alternatives. Thus, we achieve two goals: expanding Synthetic Cognition to deal with sequences, and beating the Transformer architecture for sequence classification.",

Initial 3D poses are obtained through weighted triangulation and spline smoothing, followed by kinematic optimization to refine pose accuracy. We further enhance pose realism and robustness by introducing a multi-person physics-based trajectory optimization step, effectively addressing challenges such as rapid motions, occlusions, and close interactions. Experimental results on diverse datasets, including a new benchmark of elite boxing footage, demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

By utilizing carefully processed patent data from fiscal years 1981 to 2010, we analyze the bipartite network which consists of 1,938 corporations and 35 or 124 technological fields. Our findings provide quantitative characteristics of ubiquity and sophistication for patent fields, the detailed technological trends that reflect the social context, and methodological stability for policymakers and researchers, contributing to targeted innovation strategies in Japan.",

      "abstract": "Parametric arrays (PA) offer exceptional directivity and compactness compared to conventional loudspeakers, facilitating various acoustic applications. However, accurate measurement of audio signals generated by PA remains challenging due to spurious ultrasonic sounds arising from microphone nonlinearities. Existing filtering methods, including Helmholtz resonators, phononic crystals, polymer films, and grazing incidence techniques, exhibit practical constraints such as size limitations, fabrication complexity, or insufficient attenuation. To address these issues, we propose and demonstrate a novel acoustic filter based on the design of a half-wavelength resonator. The developed filter exploits the nodal plane in acoustic pressure distribution, effectively minimizing microphone exposure to targeted ultrasonic frequencies. Fabrication via stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing ensures high dimensional accuracy, which is crucial for high-frequency acoustic filters. Finite element method (FEM) simulations guided filter optimization for suppression frequencies at 40 kHz and 60 kHz, achieving high transmission loss (TL) around 60 dB. Experimental validations confirm the filter's superior performance in significantly reducing spurious acoustic signals, as reflected in frequency response, beam pattern, and propagation curve measurements. The proposed filter ensures stable and precise acoustic characterization, independent of measurement distances and incidence angles. This new approach not only improves measurement accuracy but also enhances reliability and reproducibility in parametric array research and development.",

      "abstract": "Cops and Robbers is a game played on a graph where a set of cops attempt to capture a single robber. The game proceeds in rounds, where each round first consists of the cops' turn, followed by the robber's turn. In the cops' turn, every cop can choose to either stay on the same vertex or move to an adjacent vertex, and likewise the robber in his turn. The robber is considered to be captured if, at any point in time, there is some cop on the same vertex as the robber. A natural question in this game concerns the cop-number of a graph -- the minimum number of cops needed to capture the robber. It has long been known that graphs embeddable (without crossings) on surfaces of bounded genus have bounded cop-number. In contrast, the class of 1-planar graphs -- graphs that can be drawn on the plane with at most one crossing per edge -- does not have bounded cop-number. This paper initiates an investigation into how distance between crossing pairs of edges influences a graph's cop number. In particular, we look at Distance $d$ Cops and Robbers, a variant of the classical game, where the robber is considered to be captured if there is a cop within distance $d$ of the robber. Let $c_d(G)$ denote the minimum number of cops required in the graph $G$ to capture a robber within distance $d$. We look at various classes of graphs, such as 1-plane graphs, $k$-plane graphs (graphs where each edge is crossed at most $k$ times), and even general graph drawings, and show that if every crossing pair of edges can be connected by a path of small length, then $c_d(G)$ is bounded, for small values of $d$.",

      "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may affect up to 20 % of people over 65 years old. Global incidence of MCI is increasing, and technology is being explored for early intervention. Theories of technology adoption predict that useful and easy to use solutions will have higher rates of adoption, however, these models do not specifically consider older people with cognitive impairments, or the unique human computer interaction challenges posed by MCI. We collated opinions from older people with MCI about technology solutions proposed for them, found in 83 articles published between Jan 2014 and May 2024, and found in nine databases. Inductive, thematic analysis of feedback identified five themes (i) purpose and need, (ii) solution design and ease of use, (iii) self-impression, (iv) lifestyle, and (v) interaction modality. Solutions are perceived as useful, even though gaps in functional support exist, however, they are not perceived as entirely easy to use, due to issues related to usability and user experience. Devices which are light, portable, common and have large screens, are preferred, as is multimodal interaction, in particular speech, visual/text and touch. This review recommends future work to (i) improve usability and user experience, (ii) enhance personalisation, (iii) better understand interaction preferences and effectiveness, (iv) enable options for multimodal interaction, and (v) more seamlessly integrate solutions into users lifestyles.",

      "abstract": "Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) in a distributed manner poses significant challenges on resource-constrained edge networks. To address this challenge, we propose SflLLM, a novel framework that integrates split federated learning with parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. By leveraging model splitting and low-rank adaptation (LoRA), SflLLM reduces the computational burden on edge devices. Furthermore, the introduction of a federated server facilitates parallel training and enhances data privacy. To accommodate heterogeneous communication conditions and diverse computational capabilities of edge devices, as well as the impact of LoRA rank selection on model convergence and training cost, we formulate a joint optimization problem of both communication and computation resource. The formulated problem jointly optimizes subchannel allocation, power control, model splitting point selection, and LoRA rank configuration, aimed at minimizing total training delay. An iterative optimization algorithm is proposed to solve this problem efficiently. Specifically, a greedy heuristic is employed for subchannel allocation, the power control subproblem is reformulated as a convex optimization problem using auxiliary variables, and an exhaustive search is adopted for optimal split position and rank selection. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SflLLM framework achieves comparable model accuracy while significantly reducing client-side computational requirements. Furthermore, the proposed resource allocation scheme and adaptive LoRA rank selection strategy notably reduce the training latency compared to conventional approaches.",

This generalizes the known $O(\\log n / \\log \\log n)$ upper bound over words, and it matches the lower bound of $\\Omega(\\log n / \\log \\log n)$ from dynamic membership to some word languages and from the existential marked ancestor problem.\n  Our second contribution is to introduce a class of regular languages, dubbed almost-commutative tree languages, and show that dynamic membership to such languages under relabeling updates can be decided in constant time per update. Almost-commutative languages generalize both commutative languages and finite languages: they are the analogue for trees of the ZG languages enjoying constant-time dynamic membership over words. Our main technical contribution is to show that this class is conditionally optimal when we assume that the alphabet features a neutral letter, i.e., a letter that has no effect on membership to the language. More precisely, we show that any regular tree language with a neutral letter which is not almost-commutative cannot be maintained in constant time under the assumption that the prefix-U1 problem from (Amarilli, Jachiet, Paperman, ICALP'21) also does not admit a constant-time algorithm.",

      "abstract": "Regular expression matching is of practical importance due to its widespread use in real-world applications. In practical use, regular expressions are often used with real-world extensions. Accordingly, the matching problem of regular expressions with real-world extensions has been actively studied in recent years, yielding steady progress. However, backreference, a popular extension supported by most modern programming languages such as Java, Python, JavaScript and others in their standard libraries for string processing, is an exception to this positive trend. In fact, it is known that the matching problem of regular expressions with backreferences (rewbs) is theoretically hard and the existence of an asymptotically fast matching algorithm for arbitrary rewbs seems unlikely. Even among currently known partial solutions, the balance between efficiency and generality remains unsatisfactory. To bridge this gap, we present an efficient matching algorithm for rewbs of the form $e_0 (e)_1 e_1 \\backslash 1 e_2$ where $e_0, e, e_1, e_2$ are pure regular expressions, which are fundamental and frequently used in practical applications. It runs in quadratic time with respect to the input string length, substantially improving the best-known cubic time complexity for these rewbs. Our algorithm combines ideas from both stringology and automata theory in a novel way. We leverage two techniques from automata theory, injection and summarization, to simultaneously examine matches whose backreferenced substrings are either a fixed right-maximal repeat or its extendable prefixes, which are concepts from stringology. By further utilizing a subtle property of extendable prefixes, our algorithm correctly decides the matching problem while achieving the quadratic-time complexity.",

      "abstract": "Modern general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) systems present an urgent risk management challenge, as their rapidly evolving capabilities and potential for catastrophic harm outpace our ability to reliably assess their risks. Current methods often rely on selective testing and undocumented assumptions about risk priorities, frequently failing to make a serious attempt at assessing the set of pathways through which AI systems pose direct or indirect risks to society and the biosphere. This paper introduces the probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) for AI framework, adapting established PRA techniques from high-reliability industries (e.g., nuclear power, aerospace) for the new challenges of advanced AI. The framework guides assessors in identifying potential risks, estimating likelihood and severity bands, and explicitly documenting evidence, underlying assumptions, and analyses at appropriate granularities. The framework's implementation tool synthesizes the results into a risk report card with aggregated risk estimates from all assessed risks. It introduces three methodological advances: (1) Aspect-oriented hazard analysis provides systematic hazard coverage guided by a first-principles taxonomy of AI system aspects (e.g. capabilities, domain knowledge, affordances); (2) Risk pathway modeling analyzes causal chains from system aspects to societal impacts using bidirectional analysis and incorporating prospective techniques; and (3) Uncertainty management employs scenario decomposition, reference scales, and explicit tracing protocols to structure credible projections with novelty or limited data. Additionally, the framework harmonizes diverse assessment methods by integrating evidence into comparable, quantified absolute risk estimates for lifecycle decisions. We have implemented this as a workbook tool for AI developers, evaluators, and regulators.",

When m=n/k, the resulting function is called a minimal k-perfect hash function (MkPHF). Applications of kPHFs can be found in external memory data structures or to create efficient 1-perfect hash functions, which in turn have a wide range of applications from databases to bioinformatics. Several papers from the 1980s look at external memory data structures with small internal memory indexes. However, actual k-perfect hash functions are surprisingly rare, and the area has not seen a lot of research recently. At the same time, recent research in 1-perfect hashing shows that there is a lack of efficient kPHFs. In this paper, we revive the area of k-perfect hashing, presenting four new constructions. Our implementations simultaneously dominate older approaches in space consumption, construction time, and query time. We see this paper as a possible starting point of an active line of research, similar to the area of 1-perfect hashing.",

The penalty is based on the codelengths in the LZ77 universal lossless compression algorithm. Through the lens of the prediction-compression duality, decoding the LZ penalty has the interpretation of sampling from the residual distribution after removing the information that is highly compressible. We demonstrate the LZ penalty enables state-of-the-art open-source reasoning models to operate with greedy (temperature zero) decoding without loss of capability and without instances of degenerate repetition. Both the industry-standard frequency penalty and repetition penalty are ineffective, incurring degenerate repetition rates of up to 4%.",

However, little is known about the effectiveness and challenges in real-world AM regulation across the regulatory process -- rule operationalization, software use, and enforcement. Our multi-stakeholder study addresses this gap within workplace scheduling, one of the few AM domains with implemented regulations. We interviewed 38 stakeholders across the regulatory process: regulators, defense attorneys, worker advocates, managers, and workers. Our findings suggest that the efficacy of AM regulation is influenced by: (i) institutional constraints that challenge efforts to encode law into AM software, (ii) on-the-ground use of AM software that shapes its ability to facilitate compliance, (iii) mismatches between software and regulatory contexts that hinder enforcement, and (iv) unique concerns that software introduces when used to regulate AM. These findings underscore the importance of a sociotechnical approach to AM regulation, which considers organizational and collaborative contexts alongside the inherent attributes of software. We offer future research directions and implications for technology policy and design.",

      "abstract": "We propose manvr3d, a novel VR-ready platform for interactive human-in-the-loop cell tracking. We utilize VR controllers and eye-tracking hardware to facilitate rapid ground truth generation and proofreading for deep learning-based cell tracking models. Life scientists reconstruct the developmental history of organisms on the cellular level by analyzing 3D time-lapse microscopy images acquired at high spatio-temporal resolution. The reconstruction of such cell lineage trees traditionally involves tracking individual cells through all recorded time points, manually annotating their positions, and then linking them over time to create complete trajectories. Deep learning-based algorithms accelerate this process, yet depend heavily on manually-annotated high-quality ground truth data and curation. Visual representation of the image data in this process still relies primarily on 2D renderings, which greatly limits spatial understanding and navigation. In this work, we bridge the gap between deep learning-based cell tracking software and 3D/VR visualization to create a human-in-the-loop cell tracking system. We lift the incremental annotation, training and proofreading loop of the deep learning model into the 3rd dimension and apply natural user interfaces like hand gestures and eye tracking to accelerate the cell tracking workflow for life scientists.",

      "abstract": "This study investigates cooperation evolution mechanisms in the spatial public goods game. A novel deep reinforcement learning framework, Proximal Policy Optimization with Adversarial Curriculum Transfer (PPO-ACT), is proposed to model agent strategy optimization in dynamic environments. Traditional evolutionary game models frequently exhibit limitations in modeling long-term decision-making processes. Deep reinforcement learning effectively addresses this limitation by bridging policy gradient methods with evolutionary game theory. Our study pioneers the application of proximal policy optimization's continuous strategy optimization capability to public goods games through a two-stage adversarial curriculum transfer training paradigm. The experimental results show that PPO-ACT performs better in critical enhancement factor regimes. Compared to conventional standard proximal policy optimization methods, Q-learning and Fermi update rules, achieve earlier cooperation phase transitions and maintain stable cooperative equilibria. This framework exhibits better robustness when handling challenging scenarios like all-defector initial conditions. Systematic comparisons reveal the unique advantage of policy gradient methods in population-scale cooperation, i.e., achieving spatiotemporal payoff coordination through value function propagation. Our work provides a new computational framework for studying cooperation emergence in complex systems, algorithmically validating the punishment promotes cooperation hypothesis while offering methodological insights for multi-agent system strategy design.",

Specifically, we explore techniques designed both to deepen the model's understanding of visual content and to ensure that these visual insights actively guide language generation. We demonstrate the superior multimodal understanding of our resultant model through a detailed upstream analysis quantifying its ability to predict visually-dependent tokens as well as 10 pt boost on visually challenging tasks.",

The integration of multimodal data sources further enhances its potential. Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) is a distributed approach that enhances the efficiency and quality of multimodal learning, ensuring collaborative work and privacy protection. However, missing modalities pose a significant challenge in MFL, often due to data quality issues or privacy policies across the clients. In this work, we present MMiC, a framework for Mitigating Modality incompleteness in MFL within the Clusters. MMiC replaces partial parameters within client models inside clusters to mitigate the impact of missing modalities. Furthermore, it leverages the Banzhaf Power Index to optimize client selection under these conditions. Finally, MMiC employs an innovative approach to dynamically control global aggregation by utilizing Markovitz Portfolio Optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMiC consistently outperforms existing federated learning architectures in both global and personalized performance on multimodal datasets with missing modalities, confirming the effectiveness of our proposed solution.",

A key contributing factor to this limitation is the failure of the stress components to satisfy the equilibrium relationships. This paper develops a novel quasi-3D beam models with equilibrium-based transverse normal stress expression for achieving accurate solutions of functionally graded beams. In contrast to the conventional quasi-3D models where stress expressions are derived from constitutive and geometric equations, the expressions of transverse shear stress and transverse normal stress in this study are derived according to the differential equilibrium equations among stresses, ensuring strict adherence of stress solutions to equilibrium conditions. To incorporate the influence of equilibrium-derived stress distributions, the equilibrium-based cross-sectional stiffness matrix is derived, enhancing the theoretical and practical feasibility of the beam model. In the numerical implementation, the mixed element method with generalized internal forces and generalized displacements regarded as two independent fields is employed to construct the beam element, and especially, semi-analytical internal force fields, which partially satisfy the differential equilibrium equations, are introduced to improve the element performance. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed quasi-3D beam model accurately predicts both displacement and stress fields in functionally graded beams, which exhibits the effectiveness of introducing stress equilibrium relationships.",

According to this framework, any word, regardless of complexity, can be paraphrased using these primes, revealing a clear and universally translatable meaning. These paraphrases, known as explications, can offer valuable applications for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, but producing them has traditionally been a slow, manual process. In this work, we present the first study of using large language models (LLMs) to generate NSM explications. We introduce automatic evaluation methods, a tailored dataset for training and evaluation, and fine-tuned models for this task. Our 1B and 8B models outperform GPT-4o in producing accurate, cross-translatable explications, marking a significant step toward universal semantic representation with LLMs and opening up new possibilities for applications in semantic analysis, translation, and beyond.",

      "abstract": "Advances in AI generative models facilitate super-realistic video synthesis, amplifying misinformation risks via social media and eroding trust in digital content. Several research works have explored new deepfake detection methods on AI-generated images to alleviate these risks. However, with the fast development of video generation models, such as Sora and WanX, there is currently a lack of large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video datasets for forgery detection. In addition, existing detection approaches predominantly treat the task as binary classification, lacking explainability in model decision-making and failing to provide actionable insights or guidance for the public. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{GenBuster-200K}, a large-scale AI-generated video dataset featuring 200K high-resolution video clips, diverse latest generative techniques, and real-world scenes. We further introduce \\textbf{BusterX}, a novel AI-generated video detection and explanation framework leveraging multimodal large language model (MLLM) and reinforcement learning for authenticity determination and explainable rationale. To our knowledge, GenBuster-200K is the {\\it \\textbf{first}} large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video dataset that incorporates the latest generative techniques for real-world scenarios. BusterX is the {\\it \\textbf{first}} framework to integrate MLLM with reinforcement learning for explainable AI-generated video detection. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies validate the effectiveness and generalizability of BusterX. The code, models, and datasets will be released.",

      "abstract": "Analog computers hold promise to significantly reduce the energy consumption of artificial intelligence algorithms, but commercialization has been hampered by a fundamental scientific challenge - how to reliably store and process analog information with high precision. We present an approach based upon metal oxide memory cells that undergo controlled self-heating during programming with a newly developed, electro-thermo-chemical gate. The gate uniformly spreads heat and electrochemical reactions to enable wide, bulk-vacancy modulation which yields nine orders of magnitude in tunable analog resistance - three orders greater than other devices reported, with thousands of states. The gating profoundly reduces noise and drift to enable precision programming to targeted states within a few operations, lowering conductance errors by two orders of magnitude relative to other devices reported. Simulations show improvement in computational energy efficiency by at least 10x over other devices due to far greater scalability at higher precision. The results overturn long-held assumptions about the poor reliability and precision of analog resistance devices and opens the door to manufacturable, bulk metal-oxide devices and new applications that leverage high precision.",

This entangled encoding makes it difficult to reliably inspect, verify, or update specific facts. We propose a new class of language models, Large Memory Language Models (LMLM) with a pre-training recipe that stores factual knowledge in both internal weights and an external database. Our approach strategically masks externally retrieved factual values from the training loss, thereby teaching the model to perform targeted lookups rather than relying on memorization in model weights. Our experiments demonstrate that LMLMs achieve competitive performance compared to significantly larger, knowledge-dense LLMs on standard benchmarks, while offering the advantages of explicit, editable, and verifiable knowledge bases.

      "abstract": "Recent advances in Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled unified processing of language, vision, and structured inputs, opening the door to complex tasks such as logical deduction, spatial reasoning, and scientific analysis. Despite their promise, the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, particularly those augmented with intermediate thinking traces (MLLMs-T), remain poorly understood and lack standardized evaluation benchmarks. Existing work focuses primarily on perception or final answer correctness, offering limited insight into how models reason or fail across modalities. To address this gap, we introduce the MMLU-Reason, a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate multi-modal reasoning with explicit thinking. The MMLU-Reason comprises 1) a high-difficulty dataset of 1,083 questions spanning six diverse reasoning types with symbolic depth and multi-hop demands and 2) a modular Reasoning Trace Evaluation Pipeline (RTEP) for assessing reasoning quality beyond accuracy through metrics like relevance, consistency, and structured error annotations. Empirical results show that MLLMs-T overall outperform non-thinking counterparts, but even top models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet and Gemini-2.5 Pro suffer from reasoning pathologies such as inconsistency and overthinking. This benchmark reveals persistent gaps between accuracy and reasoning quality and provides an actionable evaluation pipeline for future model development. Overall, the MMLU-Reason offers a scalable foundation for evaluating, comparing, and improving the next generation of multi-modal reasoning systems.",

A central challenge in these systems is aligning independently collected perception data across space and time, i.e., multi-robot data association. While recent advances in collaborative SLAM (C-SLAM), map merging, and inter-robot loop closure detection have significantly progressed the field, evaluation strategies still predominantly rely on splitting a single trajectory from single-robot SLAM datasets into multiple segments to simulate multiple robots. Without careful consideration to how a single trajectory is split, this approach will fail to capture realistic pose-dependent variation in observations of a scene inherent to multi-robot systems. To address this gap, we present CU-Multi, a multi-robot dataset collected over multiple days at two locations on the University of Colorado Boulder campus. Using a single robotic platform, we generate four synchronized runs with aligned start times and deliberate percentages of trajectory overlap. CU-Multi includes RGB-D, GPS with accurate geospatial heading, and semantically annotated LiDAR data. By introducing controlled variations in trajectory overlap and dense lidar annotations, CU-Multi offers a compelling alternative for evaluating methods in multi-robot data association.

The method trains a neural network to approximate the two solution fields in a single stage, avoiding the use of nested time-stepping cycles that limit classical algorithms. For the decoupled case we prove a non-asymptotic error bound composed of an a posteriori residual plus the familiar square root dependence on the time step. Numerical experiments confirm this rate and reveal two key properties: \\emph{scalability}, in the sense that accuracy remains stable from low dimension up to 500 spatial variables while GPU batching keeps wall-clock time nearly constant; and \\emph{generality}, since the same method handles coupled systems whose forward dynamics depend on the backward solution. These results open practical access to a family of high-dimensional, path-dependent problems in stochastic control and quantitative finance.",

This paper investigates the linguistic structure of identifier names by extending the concept of grammar patterns, which represent the part-of-speech (PoS) sequences underlying identifier phrases. The specific focus is on closed syntactic categories (e.g., prepositions, conjunctions, determiners), which are rarely studied in software engineering despite their central role in general natural language. To study these categories, the Closed Category Identifier Dataset (CCID), a new manually annotated dataset of 1,275 identifiers drawn from 30 open-source systems, is constructed and presented. The relationship between closed-category grammar patterns and program behavior is then analyzed using grounded-theory-inspired coding, statistical, and pattern analysis. The results reveal recurring structures that developers use to express concepts such as control flow, data transformation, temporal reasoning, and other behavioral roles through naming. This work contributes an empirical foundation for understanding how linguistic resources encode behavior in identifier names and supports new directions for research in naming, program comprehension, and education.",

      "abstract": "Personalized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize images of user-provided concepts in diverse contexts. Despite recent progress in multi-concept personalization, most are limited to object concepts and struggle to customize abstract concepts (e.g., pose, lighting). Some methods have begun exploring multi-concept personalization supporting abstract concepts, but they require test-time fine-tuning for each new concept, which is time-consuming and prone to overfitting on limited training images. In this work, we propose a novel tuning-free method for multi-concept personalization that can effectively customize both object and abstract concepts without test-time fine-tuning. Our method builds upon the modulation mechanism in pretrained Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) model, leveraging the localized and semantically meaningful properties of the modulation space. Specifically, we propose a novel module, Mod-Adapter, to predict concept-specific modulation direction for the modulation process of concept-related text tokens. It incorporates vision-language cross-attention for extracting concept visual features, and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers that adaptively map the concept features into the modulation space. Furthermore, to mitigate the training difficulty caused by the large gap between the concept image space and the modulation space, we introduce a VLM-guided pretraining strategy that leverages the strong image understanding capabilities of vision-language models to provide semantic supervision signals. For a comprehensive comparison, we extend a standard benchmark by incorporating abstract concepts. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-concept personalization, supported by quantitative, qualitative, and human evaluations.",

      "abstract": "State Space Models (SSMs), like recent Mamba2, have achieved remarkable performance and received extensive attention. However, deploying Mamba2 on resource-constrained edge devices encounters many problems: severe outliers within the linear layer challenging the quantization, diverse and irregular element-wise tensor operations, and hardware-unfriendly nonlinear functions in the SSM block. To address these issues, this paper presents FastMamba, a dedicated accelerator on FPGA with hardware-algorithm co-design to promote the deployment efficiency of Mamba2. Specifically, we successfully achieve 8-bit quantization for linear layers through Hadamard transformation to eliminate outliers. Moreover, a hardware-friendly and fine-grained power-of-two quantization framework is presented for the SSM block and convolution layer, and a first-order linear approximation is developed to optimize the nonlinear functions. Based on the accurate algorithm quantization, we propose an accelerator that integrates parallel vector processing units, pipelined execution dataflow, and an efficient SSM Nonlinear Approximation Unit, which enhances computational efficiency and reduces hardware complexity. Finally, we evaluate FastMamba on Xilinx VC709 FPGA. For the input prefill task on Mamba2-130M, FastMamba achieves 68.80\\times and 8.90\\times speedup over Intel Xeon 4210R CPU and NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU, respectively. In the output decode experiment with Mamba2-2.7B, FastMamba attains 6\\times higher energy efficiency than RTX 3090 GPU.",

In this paper, we delve into the validation and comparison of the ethical biases of LLMs concerning globally discussed and potentially sensitive topics, hypothesizing that these biases may arise from language-specific distinctions. Introducing the Multilingual Sensitive Questions & Answers Dataset (MSQAD), we collected news articles from Human Rights Watch covering 17 topics, and generated socially sensitive questions along with corresponding responses in multiple languages. We scrutinized the biases of these responses across languages and topics, employing two statistical hypothesis tests. The results showed that the null hypotheses were rejected in most cases, indicating biases arising from cross-language differences. It demonstrates that ethical biases in responses are widespread across various languages, and notably, these biases were prevalent even among different LLMs. By making the proposed MSQAD openly available, we aim to facilitate future research endeavors focused on examining cross-language biases in LLMs and their variant models.",

But is this all we can do? We argue that in the output space of LLMs, the space of strings, exist strings expressive enough to summarize the distribution over output strings the LLM deems possible. We lay a foundation for this new avenue of uncertainty explication and present SelfReflect, a theoretically-motivated metric to assess how faithfully a string summarizes an LLM's internal answer distribution. We show that SelfReflect is able to discriminate even subtle differences of candidate summary strings and that it aligns with human judgement, outperforming alternative metrics such as LLM judges and embedding comparisons. With SelfReflect, we investigate a number of self-summarization methods and find that even state-of-the-art reasoning models struggle to explicate their internal uncertainty. But we find that faithful summarizations can be generated by sampling and summarizing. To support the development of this universal form of LLM uncertainties, we publish our metric at https://github.com/apple/ml-selfreflect",

      "abstract": "Diffusion-based large language models (Diffusion LLMs) have shown promise for non-autoregressive text generation with parallel decoding capabilities. However, the practical inference speed of open-sourced Diffusion LLMs often lags behind autoregressive models due to the lack of Key-Value (KV) Cache and quality degradation when decoding multiple tokens simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel block-wise approximate KV Cache mechanism tailored for bidirectional diffusion models, enabling cache reuse with negligible performance drop. Additionally, we identify the root cause of generation quality degradation in parallel decoding as the disruption of token dependencies under the conditional independence assumption. To address this, we propose a confidence-aware parallel decoding strategy that selectively decodes tokens exceeding a confidence threshold, mitigating dependency violations and maintaining generation quality. Experimental results on LLaDA and Dream models across multiple LLM benchmarks demonstrate up to \\textbf{27.6$\\times$ throughput} improvement with minimal accuracy loss, closing the performance gap with autoregressive models and paving the way for practical deployment of Diffusion LLMs.",

      "abstract": "Climate control is crucial for greenhouse production as it directly affects crop growth and resource use. Reinforcement learning (RL) has received increasing attention in this field, but still faces challenges, including limited training efficiency and high reliance on initial learning conditions. Interactive RL, which combines human (grower) input with the RL agent's learning, offers a potential solution to overcome these challenges. However, interactive RL has not yet been applied to greenhouse climate control and may face challenges related to imperfect inputs. Therefore, this paper aims to explore the possibility and performance of applying interactive RL with imperfect inputs into greenhouse climate control, by: (1) developing three representative interactive RL algorithms tailored for greenhouse climate control (reward shaping, policy shaping and control sharing); (2) analyzing how input characteristics are often contradicting, and how the trade-offs between them make grower's inputs difficult to perfect; (3) proposing a neural network-based approach to enhance the robustness of interactive RL agents under limited input availability; (4) conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the three interactive RL algorithms with imperfect inputs in a simulated greenhouse environment. The demonstration shows that interactive RL incorporating imperfect grower inputs has the potential to improve the performance of the RL agent. RL algorithms that influence action selection, such as policy shaping and control sharing, perform better when dealing with imperfect inputs, achieving 8.4% and 6.8% improvement in profit, respectively. In contrast, reward shaping, an algorithm that manipulates the reward function, is sensitive to imperfect inputs and leads to a 9.4% decrease in profit. This highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate mechanism when incorporating imperfect inputs.",

      "abstract": "Modern serverless applications, often interactive with highly volatile traffic, challenge system scalability, demanding control planes that deliver low latency and cost efficiency. Analysis of production traces and existing systems reveals that current control plane designs (synchronous and asynchronous), particularly when built on conventional cluster managers like Kubernetes, struggle with this balance, often wasting significant CPU and memory resources on creating underutilized or idle instances. While clean-slate approaches like Dirigent offer performance gains, they sacrifice compatibility with established cluster management ecosystems.\n  We introduce PulseNet, a serverless system designed to achieve high performance and low cost while maintaining compatibility with conventional cluster managers. PulseNet employs a novel dual-track control plane. A standard asynchronous track manages long-lived, full-featured regular instances for handling predictable, sustainable traffic, preserving full compatibility and feature sets off the critical path. Concurrently, an expedited parallel track addresses excessive traffic bursts that trigger cold starts. This fast path utilizes node-local agents (Pulselets) to rapidly spawn short-lived Emergency Instances with a reduced feature set, critically bypassing the latency overhead of the main cluster manager.\n  Our experiments demonstrate that PulseNet, while remaining compatible with conventional managers for >98% invocation traffic, achieves 35% faster end-to-end performance at a comparable cost to the incompatible Dirigent system. PulseNet outperforms Kubernetes-compatible systems with synchronous control planes by 1.5-3.5x at 8-21% lower cost, and surpasses asynchronous counterparts by 1.7-3.5x at 3-33% lower cost.",

As a result, users of these tools remain vulnerable to the very attack techniques against which they seek to protect themselves, including browser fingerprinting, cookie-based tracking, and data exfiltration. The tools we study are vulnerable in different ways, but all share a root cause: legacy Web functionality interacts with browser privacy boundaries in unexpected ways, leading to systemic vulnerabilities in tools developed, maintained, and recommended by privacy experts and activists.\n  We consider four core capabilities supported by most privacy tools and develop tests to determine whether each can be evaded through the use of local frames. We apply our tests to six popular Web privacy and security tools -- identifying at least one vulnerability in each for a total of 19 -- and extract common patterns regarding their mishandling of local frames. Our measurement of popular websites finds that 56% employ local frames and that 73.7% of the requests made by these local frames should be blocked by popular filter lists but instead trigger the vulnerabilities we identify. From another perspective, 14.3% of all sites that we crawl make requests that should be blocked inside of local frames. We disclosed these vulnerabilities to the tool authors and discuss both our experiences working with them to patch their products and the implications of our findings for other privacy and security research.",

In this work, we show that a related method, called reweighted spectral partitioning, guarantees near-optimal sparse vertex-cuts and vertex-separators in a wide variety of graph classes. In many cases, this involves little-to-no necessary dependence on maximum degree.\n  We also obtain a new proof of the planar separator theorem, a strengthened eigenvalue bound for bounded-genus graphs, and a refined form of the recent Cheeger-style inequality for vertex expansion via a specialized dimension-reduction step.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning-based approaches have demonstrated significant advancements in time series forecasting. Despite these ongoing developments, the complex dynamics of time series make it challenging to establish the rule of thumb for designing the golden model architecture. In this study, we argue that refining existing advanced models through a universal calibrating strategy can deliver substantial benefits with minimal resource costs, as opposed to elaborating and training a new model from scratch. We first identify a multi-target learning conflict in the calibrating process, which arises when optimizing variables across time steps, leading to the underutilization of the model's learning capabilities. To address this issue, we propose an innovative calibrating strategy called Socket+Plug (SoP). This approach retains an exclusive optimizer and early-stopping monitor for each predicted target within each Plug while keeping the fully trained Socket backbone frozen. The model-agnostic nature of SoP allows it to directly calibrate the performance of any trained deep forecasting models, regardless of their specific architectures. Extensive experiments on various time series benchmarks and a spatio-temporal meteorological ERA5 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of SoP, achieving up to a 22% improvement even when employing a simple MLP as the Plug (highlighted in Figure 1). Code is available at https://github.com/hanyuki23/SoP.",

      "abstract": "Rule representations significantly influence the search capabilities and decision boundaries within the search space of Learning Classifier Systems (LCSs), a family of rule-based machine learning systems that evolve interpretable models through evolutionary processes. However, it is very difficult to choose an appropriate rule representation for each problem. Additionally, some problems benefit from using different representations for different subspaces within the input space. Thus, an adaptive mechanism is needed to choose an appropriate rule representation for each rule in LCSs. This article introduces a flexible rule representation using a four-parameter beta distribution and integrates it into a fuzzy-style LCS. The four-parameter beta distribution can form various function shapes, and this flexibility enables our LCS to automatically select appropriate representations for different subspaces. Our rule representation can represent crisp/fuzzy decision boundaries in various boundary shapes, such as rectangles and bells, by controlling four parameters, compared to the standard representations such as trapezoidal ones. Leveraging this flexibility, our LCS is designed to adapt the appropriate rule representation for each subspace. Moreover, our LCS incorporates a generalization bias favoring crisp rules where feasible, enhancing model interpretability without compromising accuracy. Experimental results on real-world classification tasks show that our LCS achieves significantly superior test accuracy and produces more compact rule sets. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/YNU-NakataLab/Beta4-UCS. An extended abstract related to this work is available at https://doi.org/10.36227/techrxiv.174900805.59801248/v1.",

      "abstract": "The term scientific workflow has evolved over the last two decades to encompass a broad range of compositions of interdependent compute tasks and data movements. It has also become an umbrella term for processing in modern scientific applications. Today, many scientific applications can be considered as workflows made of multiple dependent steps, and hundreds of workflow management systems (WMSs) have been developed to manage and run these workflows. However, no turnkey solution has emerged to address the diversity of scientific processes and the infrastructure on which they are implemented. Instead, new research problems requiring the execution of scientific workflows with some novel feature often lead to the development of an entirely new WMS. A direct consequence is that many existing WMSs share some salient features, offer similar functionalities, and can manage the same categories of workflows but also have some distinct capabilities. This situation makes researchers who develop workflows face the complex question of selecting a WMS. This selection can be driven by technical considerations, to find the system that is the most appropriate for their application and for the resources available to them, or other factors such as reputation, adoption, strong community support, or long-term sustainability. To address this problem, a group of WMS developers and practitioners joined their efforts to produce a community-based terminology of WMSs. This paper summarizes their findings and introduces this new terminology to characterize WMSs. This terminology is composed of fives axes: workflow characteristics, composition, orchestration, data management, and metadata capture. Each axis comprises several concepts that capture the prominent features of WMSs. Based on this terminology, this paper also presents a classification of 23 existing WMSs according to the proposed axes and terms.",

      "abstract": "Time series classification is a fundamental task in healthcare and industry, yet the development of time series foundation models (TSFMs) remains limited by the scarcity of publicly available time series datasets. In this work, we propose Time Vision Transformer (TiViT), a framework that converts time series into images to leverage the representational power of frozen Vision Transformers (ViTs) pretrained on large-scale image datasets. First, we theoretically motivate our approach by analyzing the 2D patching of ViTs for time series, showing that it can increase the number of label-relevant tokens and reduce the sample complexity. Second, we empirically demonstrate that TiViT achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard time series classification benchmarks by utilizing the hidden representations of large OpenCLIP models. We explore the structure of TiViT representations and find that intermediate layers with high intrinsic dimension are the most effective for time series classification. Finally, we assess the alignment between TiViT and TSFM representation spaces and identify a strong complementarity, with further performance gains achieved by combining their features. Our findings reveal a new direction for reusing vision representations in a non-visual domain. Code is available at https://github.com/ExplainableML/TiViT.",

      "abstract": "In this letter, we present tightly coupled LiDAR-IMU-leg odometry, which is robust to challenging conditions such as featureless environments and deformable terrains. We developed an online learning-based leg kinematics model named the neural leg kinematics model, which incorporates tactile information (foot reaction force) to implicitly express the nonlinear dynamics between robot feet and the ground. Online training of this model enhances its adaptability to weight load changes of a robot (e.g., assuming delivery or transportation tasks) and terrain conditions. According to the \\textit{neural adaptive leg odometry factor} and online uncertainty estimation of the leg kinematics model-based motion predictions, we jointly solve online training of this kinematics model and odometry estimation on a unified factor graph to retain the consistency of both. The proposed method was verified through real experiments using a quadruped robot in two challenging situations: 1) a sandy beach, representing an extremely featureless area with a deformable terrain, and 2) a campus, including multiple featureless areas and terrain types of asphalt, gravel (deformable terrain), and grass. Experimental results showed that our odometry estimation incorporating the \\textit{neural leg kinematics model} outperforms state-of-the-art works.

      "abstract": "Function summaries, which characterize the behavior of code segments (typically functions) through preconditions and postconditions, are essential for understanding, reusing, and verifying software, particularly in safety-critical domains like aerospace embedded systems. However, these mission-critical legacy code serving as a valuable reused asset often lacks formal specifications. It is challenging to automatically generate function summaries for C programs, due to the existence of complex features such as loops, nested function calls, pointer aliasing, and so on. Moreover, function summaries should support multiple abstraction levels to meet diverse requirements, e.g. precise summaries capturing full functionality for formal verification and intuitive summaries for human understanding.\n  To address these challenges, we first propose a novel framework that combines symbolic execution, large language models (LLMs), and formal verification to generate Relatively Strongest Postconditions (RSPs) and build function summaries that fully capture program behavior. Our approach leverages VST-A's symbolic execution to precisely track program execution paths and state transitions, employs LLMs to infer loop invariants based on predefined templates, and uses Frama-C to guarantee soundness of generated summaries in an iterative refinement loop. Furthermore, from generated RSPs, we automatically synthesize strongest non-redundant postconditions expressed within given domain specific language. We compare our approach with existing work through extensive experiments.",

      "abstract": "With the growing integration of vision-language models (VLMs), mobile agents are now widely used for tasks like UI automation and camera-based user assistance. These agents are often fine-tuned on limited user-generated datasets, leaving them vulnerable to covert threats during the training process. In this work we present GHOST, the first clean-label backdoor attack specifically designed for mobile agents built upon VLMs. Our method manipulates only the visual inputs of a portion of the training samples - without altering their corresponding labels or instructions - thereby injecting malicious behaviors into the model. Once fine-tuned with this tampered data, the agent will exhibit attacker-controlled responses when a specific visual trigger is introduced at inference time. The core of our approach lies in aligning the gradients of poisoned samples with those of a chosen target instance, embedding backdoor-relevant features into the poisoned training data. To maintain stealth and enhance robustness, we develop three realistic visual triggers: static visual patches, dynamic motion cues, and subtle low-opacity overlays. We evaluate our method across six real-world Android apps and three VLM architectures adapted for mobile use. Results show that our attack achieves high attack success rates (up to 94.67 percent) while maintaining high clean-task performance (FSR up to 95.85 percent). Additionally, ablation studies shed light on how various design choices affect the efficacy and concealment of the attack. Overall, this work is the first to expose critical security flaws in VLM-based mobile agents, highlighting their susceptibility to clean-label backdoor attacks and the urgent need for effective defense mechanisms in their training pipelines.",

PresPM holds significant promise for organizations seeking enhanced operational performance. However, the current literature faces two key limitations: a lack of extensive comparisons between techniques and insufficient evaluation approaches. To address these gaps, we introduce SimBank: a simulator designed for accurate benchmarking of PresPM methods. Modeled after a bank's loan application process, SimBank enables extensive comparisons of both online and offline PresPM methods. It incorporates a variety of intervention optimization problems with differing levels of complexity and supports experiments on key causal machine learning challenges, such as assessing a method's robustness to confounding in data. SimBank additionally offers a comprehensive evaluation capability: for each test case, it can generate the true outcome under each intervention action, which is not possible using recorded datasets. The simulator incorporates parallel activities and loops, drawing from common logs to generate cases that closely resemble real-life process instances. Our proof of concept demonstrates SimBank's benchmarking capabilities through experiments with various PresPM methods across different interventions, highlighting its value as a publicly available simulator for advancing research and practice in PresPM.",

      "abstract": "Addressing the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous driving, we tackle two key issues in existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods: (1) unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations among similar categories and across regions, (2) boundary ambiguities caused by the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization and (3) biased issues in dynamic-static object coupling optimization. We propose the GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph Transformer and decouples dynamic-static objects optimization for 3D Gaussian Splatting-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarsegrained attention at higher layers models object-level topology. On the other hand, we decouple dynamic and static objects by leveraging semantic probability distributions and design a Dynamic-Static Decoupled Gaussian Attention mechanism to optimize the prediction performance for both dynamic objects and static scenes. GraphGSOcc achieves state-ofthe-art performance on the SurroundOcc-nuScenes, Occ3D-nuScenes, OpenOcc and KITTI occupancy benchmarks. Experiments on the SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 25.20%, reducing GPU memory to 6.8 GB, demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to GaussianWorld.",

In the offline setting, where reward distributions are known, we leverage submodular properties to design a greedy probing algorithm with a provable performance bound. For the more complex online setting, we develop an algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while maintaining fairness.

      "abstract": "Diffusion-based image generation models excel at producing high-quality synthetic content, but suffer from slow and computationally expensive inference. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods, however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient, per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1$.$dev using multiple metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k, PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches. On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup from 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable approach for accelerating diffusion inference.

      "abstract": "Structural coloration is commonly modeled using wave optics for reliable and photorealistic rendering of natural, quasi-periodic and complex nanostructures. Such models often rely on dense, preliminary or preprocessed data to accurately capture the nuanced variations in diffractive surface reflectances. This heavy data dependency warrants implicit neural representation which has not been addressed comprehensively in the current literature. In this paper, we present a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based method for data-driven rendering of diffractive surfaces with high accuracy and efficiency. We primarily approach this problem from a data compression perspective to devise a nuanced training and modeling method which is attuned to the domain and range characteristics of diffractive reflectance datasets. Importantly, our approach avoids over-fitting and has robust resampling behavior. Using Peak-Signal-to-Noise (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and a flipping difference evaluator (FLIP) as evaluation metrics, we demonstrate the high-quality reconstruction of the ground-truth. In comparison to a recent state-of-the-art offline, wave-optical, forward modeling approach, our method reproduces subjectively similar results with significant performance gains. We reduce the memory footprint of the raw datasets by two orders of magnitude in general. Lastly, we depict the working of our method with actual surface renderings.",

      "abstract": "Given the vast scale of the Web, crawling prioritisation techniques based on link graph traversal, popularity, link analysis, and textual content are frequently applied to surface documents that are most likely to be valuable. While existing techniques are effective for keyword-based search, both retrieval methods and user search behaviours are shifting from keyword-based matching to natural language semantic matching. The remarkable success of applying semantic matching and quality signals during ranking leads us to hypothesize that crawling could be improved by prioritizing Web pages with high semantic quality. To investigate this, we propose a semantic quality-driven prioritisation technique to enhance the effectiveness of crawling and align the crawler behaviour with recent shift towards natural language search. We embed semantic understanding directly into the crawling process -- leveraging recent neural semantic quality estimators to prioritise the crawling frontier -- with the goal of surfacing content that is semantically rich and valuable for modern search needs. Our experiments on the English subset of ClueWeb22-B and the Researchy Questions query set show that, compared to existing crawling techniques, neural crawling policies significantly improve harvest rate, maxNDCG, and search effectiveness during the early stages of crawling. Meanwhile, crawlers based on our proposed neural policies maintain comparable search performance on keyword queries from the MS MARCO Web Search query set. While this work does not propose a definitive and complete solution, it presents a forward-looking perspective on Web crawling and opens the door to a new line of research on leveraging semantic analysis to effectively align crawlers with the ongoing shift toward natural language search.",

Prior works often rely on complex architectures, explicit guider modules, or multi-stage processing pipelines, which increase structural overhead and hinder deployment. Inspired by the strong visual context modeling capacity of pre-trained video diffusion transformers, we propose FramePrompt, a minimalist yet powerful framework that treats reference images, skeleton-guided motion, and target video clips as a unified visual sequence. By reformulating animation as a conditional future prediction task, we bypass the need for guider networks and structural modifications. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms representative baselines across various evaluation metrics while also simplifying training. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of sequence-level visual conditioning and demonstrate the potential of pre-trained models for controllable animation without architectural changes.",

      "abstract": "As the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the importance of rigorous safety evaluation is becoming increasingly evident. Recent concerns within the realm of safety assessment have highlighted instances in which LLMs exhibit behaviors that appear to disable oversight mechanisms and respond in a deceptive manner. For example, there have been reports suggesting that, when confronted with information unfavorable to their own persistence during task execution, LLMs may act covertly and even provide false answers to questions intended to verify their behavior. To evaluate the potential risk of such deceptive actions toward developers or users, it is essential to investigate whether these behaviors stem from covert, intentional processes within the model. In this study, we propose that it is necessary to measure the theory of mind capabilities of LLMs. We begin by reviewing existing research on theory of mind and identifying the perspectives and tasks relevant to its application in safety evaluation. Given that theory of mind has been predominantly studied within the context of developmental psychology, we analyze developmental trends across a series of open-weight LLMs. Our results indicate that while LLMs have improved in reading comprehension, their theory of mind capabilities have not shown comparable development. Finally, we present the current state of safety evaluation with respect to LLMs' theory of mind, and discuss remaining challenges for future work.",

      "abstract": "The last decade has witnessed the proliferation of network function virtualization (NFV) in the telco industry, thanks to its unparalleled flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. However, as the NFV infrastructure is shared by virtual network functions (VNFs), sporadic resource contentions are inevitable. Such contention makes it extremely challenging to guarantee the performance of the provisioned network services, especially in high-speed regimes (e.g., Gigabit Ethernet). Existing solutions typically rely on direct traffic analysis (e.g., packet- or flow-level measurements) to detect performance degradation and identify bottlenecks, which is not always applicable due to significant integration overhead and system-level constraints. This paper complements existing solutions with a lightweight, non-intrusive framework for online performance inference that easily adapts to drift (i.e., a change over time of the actual state of our system). Instead of direct data-plane collection, we reuse hardware features in the underlying NFV infrastructure, introducing negligible interference in the data-plane. Our Drift-Resilient and Self-Tuning (DRST) framework can be integrated into existing NFV systems with minimal engineering effort and operate without the need for predefined traffic models or VNF-specific customization. DRST is deployed via a lightweight MLOps pipeline that automates the adaptation under runtime drift. We show how DRST can deliver accurate performance inference or diagnose run-time bottlenecks, as demonstrated through a comprehensive evaluation across diverse NFV scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Reasoning language models have set state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on many challenging benchmarks, enabled by multi-step reasoning induced using reinforcement learning. However, like previous language models, reasoning models are prone to generating confident, plausible responses that are incorrect (hallucinations). Knowing when and how much to trust these models is critical to the safe deployment of reasoning models in real-world applications. To this end, we explore uncertainty quantification of reasoning models in this work. Specifically, we ask three fundamental questions: First, are reasoning models well-calibrated? Second, does deeper reasoning improve model calibration? Finally, inspired by humans' innate ability to double-check their thought processes to verify the validity of their answers and their confidence, we ask: can reasoning models improve their calibration by explicitly reasoning about their chain-of-thought traces? We introduce introspective uncertainty quantification (UQ) to explore this direction. In extensive evaluations on SOTA reasoning models across a broad range of benchmarks, we find that reasoning models: (i) are typically overconfident, with self-verbalized confidence estimates often greater than 85% particularly for incorrect responses, (ii) become even more overconfident with deeper reasoning, and (iii) can become better calibrated through introspection (e.g., o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1) but not uniformly (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet becomes more poorly calibrated). Lastly, we conclude with important research directions to design necessary UQ benchmarks and improve the calibration of reasoning models.",

In these contexts, abnormalities are often reflected with unusual human poses. Thus, we propose SeeKer, a method for detecting anomalies in sequences of human skeletons. Our method formulates the skeleton sequence density through autoregressive factorization at the keypoint level. The corresponding conditional distributions represent probable keypoint locations given prior skeletal motion. We formulate the joint distribution of the considered skeleton as causal prediction of conditional Gaussians across its constituent keypoints. A skeleton is flagged as anomalous if its keypoint locations surprise our model (i.e. receive a low density). In practice, our anomaly score is a weighted sum of per-keypoint log-conditionals, where the weights account for the confidence of the underlying keypoint detector. Despite its conceptual simplicity, SeeKer surpasses all previous methods on the UBnormal and MSAD-HR datasets while delivering competitive performance on the ShanghaiTech dataset.",

      "abstract": "Illumination and texture editing are critical dimensions for world-to-world transfer, which is valuable for applications including sim2real and real2real visual data scaling up for embodied AI. Existing techniques generatively re-render the input video to realize the transfer, such as video relighting models and conditioned world generation models. Nevertheless, these models are predominantly limited to the domain of training data (e.g., portrait) or fall into the bottleneck of temporal consistency and computation efficiency, especially when the input video involves complex dynamics and long durations. In this paper, we propose TC-Light, a novel generative renderer to overcome these problems. Starting from the video preliminarily relighted by an inflated video relighting model, it optimizes appearance embedding in the first stage to align global illumination. Then it optimizes the proposed canonical video representation, i.e., Unique Video Tensor (UVT), to align fine-grained texture and lighting in the second stage. To comprehensively evaluate performance, we also establish a long and highly dynamic video benchmark. Extensive experiments show that our method enables physically plausible re-rendering results with superior temporal coherence and low computation cost.

The problem has seen considerable work in approximability, as it encompasses multiterminal cuts on graphs, $k$-cuts on hypergraphs, and elementary linear algebra problems such as matrix multiway partitioning. This research has been divided between the fixed terminal setting, where we are given a set of terminals that must be separated by $P$, and the global setting, where the only constraint is the size of the partition. We investigate a generalization that unifies these two settings: minimum submodular matroid-constrained partition. In this problem, we are additionally given a matroid over the ground set and seek to find a partition $P$ in which there exists some basis that is separated by $P$. We explore the approximability of this problem and its variants, reaching the state of the art for the special case of symmetric submodular functions, and provide results for monotone and general submodular functions as well.",

Nowadays, agents are undergoing a new round of evolution. They no longer act as an isolated island like LLMs. Instead, they start to communicate with diverse external entities, such as other agents and tools, to perform more complex tasks collectively. Under this trend, agent communication is regarded as a foundational pillar of the future AI ecosystem, and many organizations have intensively begun to design related communication protocols (e.g., Anthropic's MCP and Google's A2A) within the recent few months. However, this new field exposes significant security hazards, which can cause severe damage to real-world scenarios. To help researchers quickly figure out this promising topic and benefit the future agent communication development, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of agent communication security. More precisely, we first present a clear definition of agent communication and categorize the entire lifecycle of agent communication into three stages: user-agent interaction, agent-agent communication, and agent-environment communication. Next, for each communication phase, we dissect related protocols and analyze the security risks according to the communication characteristics. Then, we summarize and outlook on the possible defense countermeasures for each risk. In addition, we conduct experiments using MCP and A2A to help readers better understand the novel vulnerabilities brought by agent communication. Finally, we discuss open issues and future directions in this promising research field.",

Building on these approaches, we introduce the transition prediction error as an additional term in our regret approximation. To capture how training on one task affects performance on others, we further propose a lightweight metric called co-learnability. By combining these two measures, we present Transition-aware Regret Approximation with Co-learnability for Environment Design (TRACED). Empirical evaluations show that TRACED yields curricula that improve zero-shot generalization across multiple benchmarks while requiring up to 2x fewer environment interactions than strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that the transition prediction error drives rapid complexity ramp-up and that co-learnability delivers additional gains when paired with the transition prediction error. These results demonstrate how refined regret approximation and explicit modeling of task relationships can be leveraged for sample-efficient curriculum design in UED.",

      "abstract": "Advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of complex and long-context natural language tasks. However, performing long-context LLM inference locally on a commodity GPU (a PC) with privacy concerns remains challenging due to the increasing memory demands of the key-value (KV) cache. Existing systems typically identify important tokens and selectively offload their KV data to GPU and CPU memory. The KV data needs to be offloaded to disk due to the limited memory on a commodity GPU, but the process is bottlenecked by token importance evaluation overhead and the disk's low bandwidth. In this paper, we present LeoAM, the first efficient importance-aware long-context LLM inference system for a single commodity GPU with adaptive hierarchical GPU-CPU-Disk KV management. Our system employs an adaptive KV management strategy that partitions KV data into variable-sized chunks based on the skewed distribution of attention weights across different layers to reduce computational and additional transmission overheads. Moreover, we propose a lightweight KV abstract method, which minimizes transmission latency by storing and extracting the KV abstract of each chunk on disk instead of the full KV data. LeoAM also leverages the dynamic compression and pipeline techniques to further accelerate inference. Experimental results demonstrate that LongInfer achieves an average inference latency speedup of 3.46x, while maintaining comparable LLM response quality. In scenarios with larger batch sizes, it achieves up to a 5.47x speedup.",

To address these challenges, we propose SimVec, a novel simplified vector format that encodes chart elements such as mark type, position, and size. The effectiveness of SimVec is demonstrated by using MLLMs to reconstruct chart information from SimVec formats. Then, we build a new visualization dataset, SimVecVis, to enhance the performance of MLLMs in visualization understanding, which consists of three key dimensions: bitmap images of charts, their SimVec representations, and corresponding data-centric question-answering (QA) pairs with explanatory chain-of-thought (CoT) descriptions. We finetune state-of-the-art MLLMs (e.g., MiniCPM and Qwen-VL), using SimVecVis with different dataset dimensions. The experimental results show that it leads to substantial performance improvements of MLLMs with good spatial perception capabilities (e.g., MiniCPM) in data-centric QA tasks.

      "abstract": "Solving Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems (EISP) is fundamental in applications such as medical imaging, where the goal is to reconstruct the relative permittivity from scattered electromagnetic field. This inverse process is inherently ill-posed and highly nonlinear, making it particularly challenging. A recent machine learning-based approach, Img-Interiors, shows promising results by leveraging continuous implicit functions. However, it requires case-specific optimization, lacks generalization to unseen data, and fails under sparse transmitter setups (e.g., with only one transmitter). To address these limitations, we revisit EISP from a physics-informed perspective, reformulating it as a two stage inverse transmission-scattering process. This formulation reveals the induced current as a generalizable intermediate representation, effectively decoupling the nonlinear scattering process from the ill-posed inverse problem. Built on this insight, we propose the first generalizable physics-driven framework for EISP, comprising a current estimator and a permittivity solver, working in an end-to-end manner. The current estimator explicitly learns the induced current as a physical bridge between the incident and scattered field, while the permittivity solver computes the relative permittivity directly from the estimated induced current. This design enables data-driven training and generalizable feed-forward prediction of relative permittivity on unseen data while maintaining strong robustness to transmitter sparsity. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in reconstruction accuracy, generalization, and robustness. This work offers a fundamentally new perspective on electromagnetic inverse scattering and represents a major step toward cost-effective practical solutions for electromagnetic imaging.",

Beyond their classical use as chatbots, these systems are increasingly used for complex analysis and problem-solving in specialized fields, including bioinformatics. First, we introduce BIOPARS-BENCH, a dataset from over 10,000 scientific articles, textbooks, and medical websites. BioParsQA was also introduced to evaluate the proposed model, which consists of 5,231 Persian medical questions and answers. This study then introduces BioPars, a simple but accurate measure designed to assess LLMs for three main abilities: acquiring subject-specific knowledge, interpreting and synthesizing such knowledge, and demonstrating proper evidence. Comparing ChatGPT, Llama, and Galactica, our study highlights their ability to remember and retrieve learned knowledge but also reveals shortcomings in addressing higher-level, real-world questions and fine-grained inferences. These findings indicate the need for further fine-tuning to address the capabilities of LLM in bioinformatics tasks. To our knowledge, BioPars is the first application of LLM in Persian medical QA, especially for generating long answers. Evaluation of four selected medical QA datasets shows that BioPars has achieved remarkable results compared to comparative approaches. The model on BioParsQA achieved a ROUGE-L score of 29.99, which is an improvement over GPT-4 1.0. The model achieved a BERTScore of 90.87 with the MMR method. The MoverScore and BLEURT values were also higher in this model than the other three models. In addition, the reported scores for the model are MoverScore=60.43 and BLEURT=50.78. BioPars is an ongoing project and all resources related to its development will be made available via the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/amirap80/BioPars.",

To address these challenges, we propose HPC-ColPali, a Hierarchical Patch Compression framework that enhances the efficiency of ColPali while preserving its retrieval accuracy. Our approach integrates three innovative techniques: (1) K-Means quantization, which compresses patch embeddings into 1-byte centroid indices, achieving up to 32$\\times$ storage reduction; (2) attention-guided dynamic pruning, utilizing Vision-Language Model attention weights to retain only the top-$p\\%$ most salient patches, reducing late-interaction computation by up to 60\\% with less than 2\\% nDCG@10 loss; and (3) optional binary encoding of centroid indices into $b$-bit strings ($b=\\lceil\\log_2 K\\rceil$), enabling rapid Hamming distance-based similarity search for resource-constrained environments. Evaluated on the ViDoRe and SEC-Filings datasets, HPC-ColPali achieves 30--50\\% lower query latency under HNSW indexing while maintaining high retrieval precision. When integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline for legal summarization, it reduces hallucination rates by 30\\% and halves end-to-end latency.

      "abstract": "We develop a theoretical framework that explains how discrete symbolic structures can emerge naturally from continuous neural network training dynamics. By lifting neural parameters to a measure space and modeling training as Wasserstein gradient flow, we show that under geometric constraints, such as group invariance, the parameter measure $\\mu_t$ undergoes two concurrent phenomena: (1) a decoupling of the gradient flow into independent optimization trajectories over some potential functions, and (2) a progressive contraction on the degree of freedom. These potentials encode algebraic constraints relevant to the task and act as ring homomorphisms under a commutative semi-ring structure on the measure space. As training progresses, the network transitions from a high-dimensional exploration to compositional representations that comply with algebraic operations and exhibit a lower degree of freedom. We further establish data scaling laws for realizing symbolic tasks, linking representational capacity to the group invariance that facilitates symbolic solutions. This framework charts a principled foundation for understanding and designing neurosymbolic systems that integrate continuous learning with discrete algebraic reasoning.",

Unlike transformer-based architectures, LinguaSynth maintains interpretability and computational efficiency, achieving an accuracy of 84.89 percent on the 20 Newsgroups dataset and surpassing a robust TF-IDF baseline by 3.32 percent.

Previous state-of-the-art approach proposes using a Torque-inspired regularization which forces the weights of neural modules around a selected pivot point. Whereas, we observe that the pruning effect of this approach is far from perfect, as the post-trained network is still dense and also suffers from high accuracy drop. In this work, we attribute such ineffectiveness to the default linear force application scheme, which imposes inappropriate force on neural module of different distances. To efficiently prune the redundant and distant modules while retaining those that are close and necessary for effective inference, in this work, we propose Exponential Torque Pruning (ETP), which adopts an exponential force application scheme for regularization. Experimental results on a broad range of domains demonstrate that, though being extremely simple, ETP manages to achieve significantly higher compression rate than the previous state-of-the-art pruning strategies with negligible accuracy drop.",

      "abstract": "Despite progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capacity for visual reasoning is often limited by the \\textit{binding problem}: the failure to reliably associate perceptual features with their correct visual referents. This limitation underlies persistent errors in tasks such as counting, visual search, scene description, and spatial relationship understanding. A key factor is that current VLMs process visual features largely in parallel, lacking mechanisms for spatially grounded, serial attention. This paper introduces a simple yet effective intervention: augmenting visual inputs with low-level spatial structures (e.g., horizontal lines) and pairing this with a textual prompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware parsing. We empirically demonstrate substantial performance improvements across core visual reasoning tasks. Specifically, our method improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by 25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in scene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship tasks by 9.50% on a a 2D synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we find that the visual modification is essential for these gains; purely textual strategies, including Chain-of-Thought prompting, are insufficient and can even degrade performance. Our method enhances binding only with a single-query inference, underscoring the importance of visual input design over purely linguistically-based approaches. These findings suggest that low-level visual structuring is a powerful and underexplored direction for improving compositional visual reasoning and could serve as a general strategy for enhancing VLM performance on spatially grounded tasks.",

We study the complexity of the reachability problem of EOSs when subjected to non-deterministic token losses. It is known that this problem is equivalent to the coverability problem with no lossiness of conservative EOSs (cEOSs). We precisely characterize cEOS coverability into the framework of data nets, whose tokens carry data from an infinite domain. Specifically, we show that cEOS coverability is equivalent to the coverability of an interesting fragment of data nets that extends beyond $\\nu$PNs (featuring globally fresh name creation), yet remains less expressive than Unordered Data Nets (featuring lossy name creation as well as powerful forms of whole-place operations and broadcasts). This insight bridges two apparently orthogonal approaches to PN extensions, namely data nets and NWNs. At the same time, it enables us to analyze cEOS coverability taking advantage of known results on data nets. As a byproduct, we immediately get that the complexity of cEOS coverability lies between $\\mathbf{F}_{\\omega 2}$ and $\\mathbf{F}_{\\omega^\\omega}$, two classes beyond Primitive Recursive.",

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence holds great promise for expanding access to expert medical knowledge and reasoning. However, most evaluations of language models rely on static vignettes and multiple-choice questions that fail to reflect the complexity and nuance of evidence-based medicine in real-world settings. In clinical practice, physicians iteratively formulate and revise diagnostic hypotheses, adapting each subsequent question and test to what they've just learned, and weigh the evolving evidence before committing to a final diagnosis. To emulate this iterative process, we introduce the Sequential Diagnosis Benchmark, which transforms 304 diagnostically challenging New England Journal of Medicine clinicopathological conference (NEJM-CPC) cases into stepwise diagnostic encounters. A physician or AI begins with a short case abstract and must iteratively request additional details from a gatekeeper model that reveals findings only when explicitly queried. Performance is assessed not just by diagnostic accuracy but also by the cost of physician visits and tests performed. We also present the MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator (MAI-DxO), a model-agnostic orchestrator that simulates a panel of physicians, proposes likely differential diagnoses and strategically selects high-value, cost-effective tests. When paired with OpenAI's o3 model, MAI-DxO achieves 80% diagnostic accuracy--four times higher than the 20% average of generalist physicians. MAI-DxO also reduces diagnostic costs by 20% compared to physicians, and 70% compared to off-the-shelf o3. When configured for maximum accuracy, MAI-DxO achieves 85.5% accuracy. These performance gains with MAI-DxO generalize across models from the OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Grok, DeepSeek, and Llama families. We highlight how AI systems, when guided to think iteratively and act judiciously, can advance diagnostic precision and cost-effectiveness in clinical care.",

      "abstract": "Over the past decade, recommender systems have experienced a surge in popularity. Despite notable progress, they grapple with challenging issues, such as high data dimensionality and sparseness. Representing users and items as low-dimensional embeddings learned via neural networks has become a leading solution. However, while recent studies show promising results, many approaches rely on complex architectures or require content data, which may not always be available. This paper presents Interact2Vec, a novel neural network-based model that simultaneously learns distributed embeddings for users and items while demanding only implicit feedback. The model employs state-of-the-art strategies that natural language processing models commonly use to optimize the training phase and enhance the final embeddings. Two types of experiments were conducted regarding the extrinsic and intrinsic quality of the model. In the former, we benchmarked the recommendations generated by Interact2Vec's embeddings in a top-$N$ ranking problem, comparing them with six other recommender algorithms. The model achieved the second or third-best results in 30% of the datasets, being competitive with other recommenders, and has proven to be very efficient with an average training time reduction of 274% compared to other embedding-based models. Later, we analyzed the intrinsic quality of the embeddings through similarity tables. Our findings suggest that Interact2Vec can achieve promising results, especially on the extrinsic task, and is an excellent embedding-generator model for scenarios of scarce computing resources, enabling the learning of item and user embeddings simultaneously and efficiently.",

      "abstract": "Access to accurate and actionable harm reduction information can directly impact the health outcomes of People Who Use Drugs (PWUD), yet existing online channels often fail to meet their diverse and dynamic needs due to limitations in adaptability, accessibility, and the pervasive impact of stigma. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a novel opportunity to enhance information provision, but their application in such a high-stakes domain is under-explored and presents socio-technical challenges. This paper investigates how LLMs can be responsibly designed to support the information needs of PWUD. Through a qualitative workshop involving diverse stakeholder groups (academics, harm reduction practitioners, and an online community moderator), we explored LLM capabilities, identified potential use cases, and delineated core design considerations. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can address some existing information barriers (e.g., by offering responsive, multilingual, and potentially less stigmatising interactions), their effectiveness is contingent upon overcoming challenges related to ethical alignment with harm reduction principles, nuanced contextual understanding, effective communication, and clearly defined operational boundaries. We articulate design pathways emphasising collaborative co-design with experts and PWUD to develop LLM systems that are helpful, safe, and responsibly governed. This work contributes empirically grounded insights and actionable design considerations for the responsible development of LLMs as supportive tools within the harm reduction ecosystem.",

      "abstract": "Handover between a human and a dexterous robotic hand is a fundamental yet challenging task in human-robot collaboration. It requires handling dynamic environments and a wide variety of objects and demands robust and adaptive grasping strategies. However, progress in developing effective dynamic dexterous grasping methods is limited by the absence of high-quality, real-world human-to-robot handover datasets. Existing datasets primarily focus on grasping static objects or rely on synthesized handover motions, which differ significantly from real-world robot motion patterns, creating a substantial gap in applicability. In this paper, we introduce DexH2R, a comprehensive real-world dataset for human-to-robot handovers, built on a dexterous robotic hand. Our dataset captures a diverse range of interactive objects, dynamic motion patterns, rich visual sensor data, and detailed annotations. Additionally, to ensure natural and human-like dexterous motions, we utilize teleoperation for data collection, enabling the robot's movements to align with human behaviors and habits, which is a crucial characteristic for intelligent humanoid robots. Furthermore, we propose an effective solution, DynamicGrasp, for human-to-robot handover and evaluate various state-of-the-art approaches, including auto-regressive models and diffusion policy methods, providing a thorough comparison and analysis. We believe our benchmark will drive advancements in human-to-robot handover research by offering a high-quality dataset, effective solutions, and comprehensive evaluation metrics.",

      "abstract": "In machine learning security, one is often faced with the problem of removing outliers from a given set of high-dimensional vectors when computing their average. For example, many variants of data poisoning attacks produce gradient vectors during training that are outliers in the distribution of clean gradients, which bias the computed average used to derive the ML model. Filtering them out before averaging serves as a generic defense strategy. Byzantine robust aggregation is an algorithmic primitive which computes a robust average of vectors, in the presence of an $\\epsilon$ fraction of vectors which may have been arbitrarily and adaptively corrupted, such that the resulting bias in the final average is provably bounded.\n  In this paper, we give the first robust aggregator that runs in quasi-linear time in the size of input vectors and provably has near-optimal bias bounds. Our algorithm also does not assume any knowledge of the distribution of clean vectors, nor does it require pre-computing any filtering thresholds from it. This makes it practical to use directly in standard neural network training procedures. We empirically confirm its expected runtime efficiency and its effectiveness in nullifying 10 different ML poisoning attacks.",

      "abstract": "Implementing economy-wide decarbonization strategies based on decarbonizing the power grid via variable renewable energy (VRE) expansion and electrification of end-uses requires new approaches for energy infrastructure planning that consider, among other factors, weather-induced uncertainty in demand and VRE supply. An energy planning model that fails to account for these uncertainties can hinder the intended transition efforts to a low-carbon grid and increase the risk of supply shortage especially during extreme weather conditions. Here, we consider the generation and transmission expansion problem of joint power-gas infrastructure and operations planning under the uncertainty of both demand and renewable supply. We propose two distributionally robust optimization approaches based on moment (MDRO) and Wasserstein distance (WDRO) ambiguity sets to endogenize these uncertainties and account for the change in the underlying distribution of these parameters that is caused by the climate change, among other factors. Furthermore, our model considers the risk-aversion of the energy planners in the modeling framework via the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) metric. An equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) reformulation of both modeling frameworks is presented, and a computationally efficient approximation scheme to obtain near-optimal solutions is proposed. We demonstrate the resulting DRO planning models and solution strategy via a New England case study under different levels of end-use electrification and decarbonization targets. Our experiments systematically explore different modeling aspects and compare the DRO models with stochastic programming (SP) results.",

We hypothesise that privacy-focused services are typically more energy-efficient than those funded through data collection and advertising. To evaluate this, we propose a framework that systematically measures environmental costs based on energy usage and network data traffic during well-defined, automated usage scenarios. To test our hypothesis, we first analyse how underlying architectures and business models, such as monetisation through personalised advertising, contribute to the environmental footprint of these services. We then explore existing methodologies and tools for software environmental impact assessment. We apply our framework to three mainstream email services selected to reflect different privacy policies, from ad-supported tracking-intensive models to privacy-focused designs: Microsoft Outlook, Google Mail (Gmail), and Proton Mail. We extend this comparison to a self-hosted email solution, evaluated with and without end-to-end encryption. We show that the self-hosted solution, even with 14% of device energy and 15% of emissions overheads from PGP encryption, remains the most energy-efficient, saving up to 33% of emissions per session compared to Gmail. Among commercial providers, Proton Mail is the most efficient, saving up to 0.1 gCO2 e per session compared to Outlook, whose emissions can be further reduced by 2% through ad-blocking.",

      "abstract": "A linear layout of a graph consists of a linear ordering of its vertices and a partition of its edges into pages such that the edges assigned to the same page obey some constraint. The two most prominent and widely studied types of linear layouts are stack and queue layouts, in which any two edges assigned to the same page are forbidden to cross and nest, respectively. The names of these two layouts derive from the fact that, when parsing the graph according to the linear vertex ordering, the edges in a single page can be stored using a single stack or queue, respectively. Recently, the concepts of stack and queue layouts have been extended by using a double-ended queue or a restricted-input queue for storing the edges of a page. We extend this line of study to edge-weighted graphs by introducing priority queue layouts, that is, the edges on each page are stored in a priority queue whose keys are the edge weights. First, we show that there are edge-weighted graphs that require a linear number of priority queues. Second, we characterize the graphs that admit a priority queue layout with a single queue, regardless of the edge-weight function, and we provide an efficient recognition algorithm. Third, we show that the number of priority queues required independently of the edge-weight function is bounded by the pathwidth of the graph, but can be arbitrarily large already for graphs of treewidth two. Finally, we prove that determining the minimum number of priority queues is NP-complete if the linear ordering of the vertices is fixed.",

      "abstract": "In precision agriculture, one of the most important tasks when exploring crop production is identifying individual plant components. There are several attempts to accomplish this task by the use of traditional 2D imaging, 3D reconstructions, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). However, they have several drawbacks when processing 3D data and identifying individual plant components. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel Deep Learning architecture to detect components of individual plants on Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) 3D Point Cloud (PC) data sets. This architecture is based on the concept of Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and feature enhancing with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). For this, each point is taken as a vertex and by the use of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) layer, the edges are established, thus representing the 3D PC data set. Subsequently, Edge-Conv layers are used to further increase the features of each point. Finally, Graph Attention Networks (GAT) are applied to classify visible phenotypic components of the plant, such as the leaf, stem, and soil. This study demonstrates that our graph-based deep learning approach enhances segmentation accuracy for identifying individual plant components, achieving percentages above 80% in the IoU average, thus outperforming other existing models based on point clouds.",

We establish novel results for convergence rates of numerical approximations of such models under reasonable assumptions on exact solutions, and prove the existence and uniqueness of the approximate solution for suitably small time steps. The main interest of our results lies in covering several approximation methods and various applications of the considered model such as the generalised Burgers-Fisher (GBF) and the generalised Burgers-Huxley (GBH) models. Numerical tests based on the hybrid mimetic mixed (HMM) method for the GBF model are performed on various types of general meshes to examine the accuracy of the proposed gradient scheme. The results confirm our theoretical rates of convergence, even on mesh with extreme distortions.",

The set of vertices V(G) is partitioned as V_1, V_2, ... ,V_c, where all vertices in V_j share the same color j. A subset S of V(G) is called Selective Subset if, for every vertex v in V(G), and if v is in V_j, at least one of its nearest neighbors in (S union (V(G)\\ V_j)) has the same color as v. The Minimum Selective Subset (MSS) problem seeks to find a selective subset of minimum size. The problem was first introduced by Wilfong in 1991 for a set of points in the Euclidean plane, where two major problems, MCS (Minimum Consistent Subset) and MSS, were proposed.\n  In graph algorithms, the only known result is that the MSS problem is NP-complete, as shown in 2018. Beyond this, no further progress has been made to date. In contrast, the MCS problem has been widely studied in various graph classes over the years. Therefore, in this work, we also extend the algorithmic study of MSS on various graph classes. We first present a log(n)-approximation algorithm for general graphs with n vertices and regardless of the number of colors. We also show that the problem remains NP-complete in planar graphs when restricted to just two colors.. Finally, we provide polynomial-time algorithms for computing optimal solutions in trees and unit interval graphs for any number of colors.",

      "abstract": "Data heterogeneity is a central challenge in federated learning, and personalized federated learning (PFL) aims to address it by tailoring models to each client's distribution. Yet many PFL methods fail to outperform local or centralized baselines, suggesting a mismatch between the collaboration they enforce and the structure of the data. We propose an approach based on adaptive collaboration, where clients decide adaptively not only how much to rely on others, but also whom to trust at the level of individual examples. We instantiate this principle in FEDMOSAIC, a federated co-training method in which clients exchange predictions over a shared unlabeled dataset. This enables fine-grained trust decisions that are difficult to achieve with parameter sharing alone. Each client adjusts its loss weighting based on the agreement between private and public data, and contributes to global pseudo-labels in proportion to its estimated per-example confidence. Empirically, FEDMOSAIC improves upon state-of-the-art PFL methods across diverse non-IID settings, and we provide convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. Our results demonstrate the potential of data-aware collaboration for robust and effective personalization.",

      "abstract": "Digital pathology has revolutionized the field by enabling the digitization of tissue samples into whole slide images (WSIs). However, the high resolution and large size of WSIs present significant challenges when it comes to applying Deep Learning models. As a solution, WSIs are often divided into smaller patches with a global label (\\textit{i.e., diagnostic}) per slide, instead of a (too) costly pixel-wise annotation. By treating each slide as a bag of patches, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have emerged as a suitable solution for WSI classification. A major drawback of MIL methods is their high variability in performance across different runs, which can reach up to 10-15 AUC points on the test set, making it difficult to compare different MIL methods reliably. This variability mainly comes from three factors: i) weight initialization, ii) batch (shuffling) ordering, iii) and learning rate. To address that, we introduce a Multi-Fidelity, Model Fusion strategy for MIL methods. We first train multiple models for a few epochs and average the most stable and promising ones based on validation scores. This approach can be applied to any existing MIL model to reduce performance variability. It also simplifies hyperparameter tuning and improves reproducibility while maintaining computational efficiency. We extensively validate our approach on WSI classification tasks using 2 different datasets, 3 initialization strategies and 5 MIL methods, for a total of more than 2000 experiments.",

      "abstract": "Automated radiology report generation (RRG) aims to produce detailed textual reports from clinical imaging, such as computed tomography (CT) scans, to improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis and provision of management advice. RRG is complicated by two key challenges: (1) inherent complexity in extracting relevant information from imaging data under resource constraints, and (2) difficulty in objectively evaluating discrepancies between model-generated and expert-written reports. To address these challenges, we propose $\\mu^2$LLM, a $\\underline{\\textbf{mu}}$ltiscale $\\underline{\\textbf{mu}}$ltimodal large language models for RRG tasks. The novel ${\\mu}^2$Tokenizer, as an intermediate layer, integrates multi-modal features from the multiscale visual tokenizer and the text tokenizer, then enhances report generation quality through direct preference optimization (DPO), guided by GREEN-RedLlama. Experimental results on four large CT image-report medical datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, highlighting the potential of our fine-tuned $\\mu^2$LLMs on limited data for RRG tasks. At the same time, for prompt engineering, we introduce a five-stage, LLM-driven pipeline that converts routine CT reports into paired visual-question-answer triples and citation-linked reasoning narratives, creating a scalable, high-quality supervisory corpus for explainable multimodal radiology LLM. All code, datasets, and models will be publicly available in our official repository. https://github.com/Siyou-Li/u2Tokenizer",

      "abstract": "Region of Interest (ROI)-based image compression optimizes bit allocation by prioritizing ROI for higher-quality reconstruction. However, as the users (including human clients and downstream machine tasks) become more diverse, ROI-based image compression needs to be customizable to support various preferences. For example, different users may define distinct ROI or require different quality trade-offs between ROI and non-ROI. Existing ROI-based image compression schemes predefine the ROI, making it unchangeable, and lack effective mechanisms to balance reconstruction quality between ROI and non-ROI. This work proposes a paradigm for customizable ROI-based deep image compression. First, we develop a Text-controlled Mask Acquisition (TMA) module, which allows users to easily customize their ROI for compression by just inputting the corresponding semantic \\emph{text}. It makes the encoder controlled by text. Second, we design a Customizable Value Assign (CVA) mechanism, which masks the non-ROI with a changeable extent decided by users instead of a constant one to manage the reconstruction quality trade-off between ROI and non-ROI. Finally, we present a Latent Mask Attention (LMA) module, where the latent spatial prior of the mask and the latent Rate-Distortion Optimization (RDO) prior of the image are extracted and fused in the latent space, and further used to optimize the latent representation of the source image. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed customizable ROI-based deep image compression paradigm effectively addresses the needs of customization for ROI definition and mask acquisition as well as the reconstruction quality trade-off management between the ROI and non-ROI.",

It aims to precisely filter the massive tools into a small set of candidates for the downstream tool-augmented LLMs. However, most existing approaches primarily focus on optimizing tool representations, often neglecting the importance of precise query comprehension. To address this gap, we introduce MassTool, a multi-task search-based framework designed to enhance both query representation and tool retrieval accuracy. MassTool employs a two-tower architecture: a tool usage detection tower that predicts the need for function calls, and a tool retrieval tower that leverages a query-centric graph convolution network (QC-GCN) for effective query-tool matching. It also incorporates search-based user intent modeling (SUIM) to handle diverse and out-of-distribution queries, alongside an adaptive knowledge transfer (AdaKT) module for efficient multi-task learning. By jointly optimizing tool usage detection loss, list-wise retrieval loss, and contrastive regularization loss, MassTool establishes a robust dual-step sequential decision-making pipeline for precise query understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in improving retrieval accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/wxydada/MassTool.",

Although recent work has extended this line of research into machine vision, there has been a scarcity of studies systematically exploring its perceptual boundaries across multiple tasks and stimulus types, particularly in the current era of rapidly advancing large multimodal models (LMMs), where studying the multifaceted capabilities of models has become a mainstream focus. Moreover, the perceptual defects of LMMs are not investigated thoroughly, resulting in potential security issues and suboptimal response efficiency. In this paper, we take an initial attempt and demonstrate that there exist significant visual blind spots in current LMMs. To systemically quantify this characteristic, we propose a new concept, {\\bf LMM-JND}, together with its determination pipeline. Targeting uncovering the behavior commonalities in HVS-aligned visual perception tasks, we delve into several LMM families and construct a large-scale dataset, named VPA-JND, which contains 21.5k reference images with over 489k stimuli across 12 distortion types, to facilitate LMM-JND studies. VPA-JND exposes areas where state-of-the-art LMMs, including GPT-4o and the InternVL2.5 series, struggle with basic comparison queries and fall significantly short of human-level visual performance. We further explore the effects of vision and language backbones and find a notable correlation between their design philosophy that may instruct the future refinement of LMMs for their visual acuity. Together, our research underscores the significance of LMM-JND as a unique perspective for studying LMMs, and predictable LMM-JND is crucial for security concerns.

      "abstract": "Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to enable models to adapt on-the-fly to a stream of unlabeled data under evolving distribution shifts. However, existing CTTA methods typically rely on shared model parameters across all domains, making them vulnerable to feature entanglement and catastrophic forgetting in the presence of large or non-stationary domain shifts. To address this limitation, we propose ExPaMoE, a novel framework based on an Expandable Parallel Mixture-of-Experts architecture. ExPaMoE decouples domain-general and domain-specific knowledge via a dual-branch expert design with token-guided feature separation, and dynamically expands its expert pool based on a Spectral-Aware Online Domain Discriminator (SODD) that detects distribution changes in real-time using frequency-domain cues. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of ExPaMoE across diverse CTTA scenarios. We evaluate our method on standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, ImageNet-C, and Cityscapes-to-ACDC for semantic segmentation. Additionally, we introduce ImageNet++, a large-scale and realistic CTTA benchmark built from multiple ImageNet-derived datasets, to better reflect long-term adaptation under complex domain evolution. ExPaMoE consistently outperforms prior arts, showing strong robustness, scalability, and resistance to forgetting.",

Numerous in-browser ANNS engines have emerged to seamlessly integrate with popular LLM-based web applications, while addressing privacy protection and challenges of heterogeneous device deployments. However, web browsers present unique challenges for ANNS, including computational limitations, external storage access issues, and memory utilization constraints, which state-of-the-art (SOTA) solutions fail to address comprehensively. We propose WebANNS, a novel ANNS engine specifically designed for web browsers. WebANNS leverages WebAssembly to overcome computational bottlenecks, designs a lazy loading strategy to optimize data retrieval from external storage, and applies a heuristic approach to reduce memory usage. Experiments show that WebANNS is fast and memory efficient, achieving up to $743.8\\times$ improvement in 99th percentile query latency over the SOTA engine, while reducing memory usage by up to 39\\%. Note that WebANNS decreases query time from 10 seconds to the 10-millisecond range in browsers, making in-browser ANNS practical with user-acceptable latency.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents an innovative Reduced-Order Model (ROM) for merging experimental and simulation data using Data Assimilation (DA) to estimate the \"True\" state of a fluid dynamics system, leading to more accurate predictions. Our methodology introduces a novel approach implementing the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) within a reduced-dimensional framework, grounded in a robust theoretical foundation and applied to fluid dynamics. To address the substantial computational demands of DA, the proposed ROM employs low-resolution (LR) techniques to drastically reduce computational costs. This approach involves downsampling datasets for DA computations, followed by an advanced reconstruction technique based on low-cost Singular Value Decomposition (lcSVD). The lcSVD method, a key innovation in this paper, has never been applied to DA before and offers a highly efficient way to enhance resolution with minimal computational resources. Our results demonstrate significant reductions in both computation time and RAM usage through the LR techniques without compromising the accuracy of the estimations. For instance, in a turbulent test case, the LR approach with a compression rate of 15.9 can achieve a speed-up of 13.7 and a RAM compression of 90.9% while maintaining a low Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE) of 2.6%, compared to 0.8% in the high-resolution (HR) reference. Furthermore, we highlight the effectiveness of the EnKF in estimating and predicting the state of fluid flow systems based on limited observations and low-fidelity numerical data. This paper highlights the potential of the proposed DA method in fluid dynamics applications, particularly for improving computational efficiency in CFD and related fields. Its ability to balance accuracy with low computational and memory costs makes it suitable for large-scale and real-time applications, such as environmental monitoring or aerospace.",

      "abstract": "This paper addresses the limited transfer and adaptation capabilities of large language models in low-resource language scenarios. It proposes a unified framework that combines a knowledge transfer module with parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies. The method introduces knowledge alignment loss and soft prompt tuning to guide the model in effectively absorbing the structural features of target languages or tasks under minimal annotation. This enhances both generalization performance and training stability. The framework includes lightweight adaptation modules to reduce computational costs. During training, it integrates freezing strategies and prompt injection to preserve the model's original knowledge while enabling quick adaptation to new tasks. The study also conducts stability analysis experiments and synthetic pseudo-data transfer experiments to systematically evaluate the method's applicability and robustness across different low-resource tasks. Experimental results show that compared with existing multilingual pre-trained models and mainstream transfer methods, the proposed approach achieves higher performance and stability on cross-lingual tasks such as MLQA, XQuAD, and PAWS-X. It demonstrates particularly strong advantages under extremely data-scarce conditions. The proposed method offers strong generality and scalability. It enhances task-specific adaptability while preserving the general capabilities of large language models. This makes it well-suited for complex semantic modeling and multilingual processing tasks.",

We investigate whether LLMs can develop strategic reasoning capabilities through RL in chess. To this end, we leverage a chess-pretrained action-value network to provide dense reward on the LLM's output move quality, which can be seen as a form of knowledge distillation. Our experiments show that our distillation-based dense rewards often outperform sparse binary rewards. However, surprisingly, all models plateau far below expert levels. We provide SFT and RL ablations on chess reasoning training and find evidence that this limitation stems from a deficit in the pretrained models' internal understanding of chess--a deficit which RL alone may not be able to fully overcome.",

This study investigates the utilization of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) as a mechanism for improving RL performance in an industrially inspired sorting environment. We propose a novel approach in which GA-generated expert demonstrations are used to enhance policy learning. These demonstrations are incorporated into a Deep Q-Network (DQN) replay buffer for experience-based learning and utilized as warm-start trajectories for Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agents to accelerate training convergence. Our experiments compare standard RL training with rule-based heuristics, brute-force optimization, and demonstration data, revealing that GA-derived demonstrations significantly improve RL performance. Notably, PPO agents initialized with GA-generated data achieved superior cumulative rewards, highlighting the potential of hybrid learning paradigms, where heuristic search methods complement data-driven RL. The utilized framework is publicly available and enables further research into adaptive RL strategies for real-world applications.",

While this iterative feedback-based refinement process is important in actual recordings, it has been overlooked in text-to-speech synthesis (TTS). As a result, fine-grained style refinement after the initial synthesis is not possible, even though the synthesized speech often deviates from the user's intended style. To address this issue, we propose a TTS method with multi-step interaction that allows users to intuitively and rapidly refine synthesized speech. Our approach models the interaction between the TTS model and its user to emulate the relationship between voice actors and voice directors. Experiments show that the proposed model with its corresponding dataset enables iterative style refinements in accordance with users' directions, thus demonstrating its multi-interaction capability.

      "abstract": "Efficient sampling from the Boltzmann distribution defined by an energy function is a key challenge in modeling physical systems such as molecules. Boltzmann Generators tackle this by leveraging Continuous Normalizing Flows that transform a simple prior into a distribution that can be reweighted to match the Boltzmann distribution using sample likelihoods. However, obtaining likelihoods requires computing costly Jacobians during integration, making it impractical for large molecular systems. To overcome this, we propose learning the likelihood of the generated distribution via an energy-based model trained with noise contrastive estimation and score matching. By using stochastic interpolants to anneal between the prior and generated distributions, we combine both the objective functions to efficiently learn the density function. On the alanine dipeptide system, we demonstrate that our method yields free energy profiles and energy distributions comparable to those obtained with exact likelihoods. Additionally, we show that free energy differences between metastable states can be estimated accurately with orders-of-magnitude speedup.",

Unlike previous approaches, our focus is on training in-context learners to adapt to sequences of tasks, rather than individual tasks. Our goal is to solve complex tasks that involve multiple intermediate steps using a single model, allowing users to define entire vision pipelines flexibly at test time. To achieve this, we first examine the properties and limitations of visual in-context learning architectures, with a particular focus on the role of codebooks. We then introduce a novel method for training in-context learners using a synthetic compositional task generation engine. This engine bootstraps task sequences from arbitrary segmentation datasets, enabling the training of visual in-context learners for compositional tasks. Additionally, we investigate different masking-based training objectives to gather insights into how to train models better for solving complex, compositional tasks. Our exploration not only provides important insights especially for multi-modal medical task sequences but also highlights challenges that need to be addressed.",

The problem arises naturally in settings where one wishes to explain or enforce a given solution by minimally perturbing the input.\n  We extend this classical problem by replacing the fixed basis with a subset $S_0$ of the ground set and imposing various structural constraints on the set of maximum-weight bases relative to $S_0$. Specifically, we study six variants: (A) Inverse Matroid Exists, where $S_0$ must contain at least one maximum-weight basis; (B) Inverse Matroid All, where all bases contained in $S_0$ are maximum-weight; and (C) Inverse Matroid Only, where $S_0$ contains exactly the maximum-weight bases, along with their natural negated counterparts.\n  For all variants, we develop combinatorial polynomial-time algorithms under the $\\ell_\\infty$-norm. A key ingredient is a refined min-max theorem for Inverse Matroid under the $\\ell_\\infty$-norm, which enables simpler and faster algorithms than previous approaches and may be of independent combinatorial interest. Our work significantly broadens the range of inverse optimization problems on matroids that can be solved efficiently, especially those that constrain the structure of optimal solutions through subset inclusion or exclusion.",

      "abstract": "Text-to-image generation has greatly advanced content creation, yet accurately rendering visual text remains a key challenge due to blurred glyphs, semantic drift, and limited style control. Existing methods often rely on pre-rendered glyph images as conditions, but these struggle to retain original font styles and color cues, necessitating complex multi-branch designs that increase model overhead and reduce flexibility. To address these issues, we propose a segmentation-guided framework that uses pixel-level visual text masks -- rich in glyph shape, color, and spatial detail -- as unified conditional inputs. Our method introduces two core components: (1) a fine-tuned bilingual segmentation model for precise text mask extraction, and (2) a streamlined diffusion model augmented with adaptive glyph conditioning and a region-specific loss to preserve textual fidelity in both content and style. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AnyText benchmark, significantly surpassing prior methods in both Chinese and English settings. To enable more rigorous evaluation, we also introduce two new benchmarks: GlyphMM-benchmark for testing layout and glyph consistency in complex typesetting, and MiniText-benchmark for assessing generation quality in small-scale text regions. Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing methods by a large margin in both scenarios, particularly excelling at small text rendering and complex layout preservation, validating its strong generalization and deployment readiness.",

      "abstract": "Linear attention mechanisms deliver significant advantages for Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing linear computational complexity, enabling efficient processing of ultra-long sequences (e.g., 1M context). However, existing Sequence Parallelism (SP) methods, essential for distributing these workloads across devices, become the primary bottleneck due to substantial communication overhead. In this paper, we introduce ZeCO (Zero Communication Overhead) sequence parallelism for linear attention models, a new SP method designed to overcome these limitations and achieve end-to-end near-linear scalability for long sequence training. For example, training a model with a 1M sequence length across 64 devices using ZeCO takes roughly the same time as training with an 16k sequence on a single device. At the heart of ZeCO lies All-Scan, a new collective communication primitive. All-Scan provides each SP rank with precisely the initial operator state it requires while maintaining a minimal communication footprint, effectively eliminating communication overhead. Theoretically, we prove the optimaity of ZeCO, showing that it introduces only negligible time and space overhead. Empirically, we compare the communication costs of different sequence parallelism strategies and demonstrate that All-Scan achieves the fastest communication in SP scenarios. Specifically, on 256 GPUs with an 8M sequence length, ZeCO achieves a 60\\% speedup compared to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) SP method. We believe ZeCO establishes a clear path toward efficiently training next-generation LLMs on previously intractable sequence lengths.",

In this report, we share our key findings in the development of the reasoning-centric training framework. We first develop a capable vision foundation model with significant potential through large-scale pre-training, which arguably sets the upper bound for the final performance. We then propose Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS) to unlock the full potential of the model, leading to comprehensive capability enhancement across a diverse range of tasks, including STEM problem solving, video understanding, content recognition, coding, grounding, GUI-based agents, and long document understanding. We open-source GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking, which achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of comparable size. In a comprehensive evaluation across 28 public benchmarks, our model outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B on nearly all tasks and achieves comparable or even superior performance on 18 benchmarks relative to the significantly larger Qwen2.5-VL-72B. Notably, GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking also demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to closed-source models such as GPT-4o on challenging tasks including long document understanding and STEM reasoning, further underscoring its strong capabilities.

This result holds whenever the temperature is greater than four plus twice the maximum interaction degree (valence) over all qubits, measured in units of the local coupling strength. For example, this implies that the classical simulation of the thermal state of a superconducting device modeling a frustrated quantum Ising model with maximum valence of 6 and coupling strengths of 1 GHz is always possible at temperatures above 800 mK. Despite the quantum system being at high temperature, the classical spin system resulting from the quantum-to-classical mapping contains strong couplings which cause the single-site Glauber dynamics to mix slowly, therefore this result depends on the use of worldline updates (which are a form of cluster updates that can be implemented efficiently). This result places definite constraints on the temperatures required for a quantum advantage in analog quantum simulation with various NISQ devices based on equilibrium states of quantum Ising models.",

      "abstract": "The nonconvex formulation of the matrix completion problem has received significant attention in recent years due to its affordable complexity compared to the convex formulation. Gradient Descent (GD) is a simple yet efficient baseline algorithm for solving nonconvex optimization problems. The success of GD has been witnessed in many different problems in both theory and practice when it is combined with random initialization. However, previous works on matrix completion require either careful initialization or regularizers to prove the convergence of GD. In this paper, we study the rank-1 symmetric matrix completion and prove that GD converges to the ground truth when small random initialization is used. We show that in a logarithmic number of iterations, the trajectory enters the region where local convergence occurs. We provide an upper bound on the initialization size that is sufficient to guarantee the convergence, and show that a larger initialization can be used as more samples are available. We observe that the implicit regularization effect of GD plays a critical role in the analysis, and for the entire trajectory, it prevents each entry from becoming much larger than the others.",

The worst-case robustness against these so-called adversarial examples can be quantified by the Lipschitz constant of the neural network. In this paper, we study upper and lower bounds for the Lipschitz constant of random ReLU neural networks. Specifically, we assume that the weights and biases follow a generalization of the He initialization, where general symmetric distributions for the biases are permitted. For deep networks of fixed depth and sufficiently large width, our established upper bound is larger than the lower bound by a factor that is logarithmic in the width. In contrast, for shallow neural networks we characterize the Lipschitz constant up to an absolute numerical constant that is independent of all parameters.",

In this work, we explore diffusion-based counterfactual explainable AI to generate realistic, high-quality standard planes from low-quality non-standard ones. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating plausible counterfactuals of increased quality.

By encoding multiple points into the quantum circuit to predict subsequent data, each point becomes a feature, transforming the problem into a multidimensional one. Building on theoretical foundations from prior research, which demonstrated that Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) can be expressed as multidimensional Fourier series, we explore the capabilities of different architectures and ansatz. This analysis considers the concepts of circuit expressibility and the presence of barren plateaus. Analyzing the problem within the framework of the Fourier series enabled the design of an architecture that incorporates data reuploading, resulting in enhanced performance. Rather than a strict requirement for the number of free parameters to exceed the degrees of freedom of the Fourier series, our findings suggest that even a limited number of parameters can produce Fourier functions of higher degrees. This highlights the remarkable expressive power of quantum circuits. This observation is also significant in reducing training times. The ansatz with greater expressibility and number of non-zero Fourier coefficients consistently delivers favorable results across different scenarios, with performance metrics improving as the number of qubits increases.",

      "abstract": "The movement of small but finite spherical particles in a fluid can be described by the Maxey-Riley equation (MRE) if they are too large to be considered passive tracers. The MRE contains an integral \"history term\" modeling wake effects, which causes the force acting on a particle at some given time to depend on its full past trajectory. The history term causes complications in the numerical solution of the MRE and is therefore often neglected, despite both numerical and experimental evidence that its effects are generally not negligible. By numerically computing trajectories with and without the history term of a large number of particles in different flow fields, we investigate its impact on the large-scale Lagrangian dynamics of simulated particles. We show that for moderate to large Stokes numbers, ignoring the history term leads to significant differences in clustering patterns. Furthermore, we compute finite-time Lyapunov exponents and show that, even for small particles, the differences in the resulting scalar field from ignoring the BHT can be significant, in particular if the underlying flow is turbulent.",

A standard solution method for these problems is to consider the infinite population limit as an approximation and use symmetric solutions of the limit problem to achieve near optimality. The control policies, and in particular the dynamics, depend on the population distribution in the finite population setting, or the marginal distribution of the state variable of a representative agent for the infinite population setting. Hence, learning and planning for these control problems generally require estimating the reaction of the system to all possible state distributions of the agents. To overcome this issue, we consider linear function approximation for the control problem and provide coordinated and independent learning methods. We rigorously establish error upper bounds for the performance of learned solutions. The performance gap stems from (i) the mismatch due to estimating the true model with a linear one, and (ii) using the infinite population solution in the finite population problem as an approximate control. The provided upper bounds quantify the impact of these error sources on the overall performance.",

One challenge facing drug discovery AI is that drug pharmacokinetic (PK) datasets are often collected independently from each other, often with limited overlap, creating data overlap sparsity. Data sparsity makes data curation difficult for researchers looking to answer research questions in poly-pharmacy, drug combination research, and high-throughput screening. We propose Imagand, a novel SMILES-to-Pharmacokinetic (S2PK) diffusion model capable of generating an array of PK target properties conditioned on SMILES inputs. We show that Imagand-generated synthetic PK data closely resembles real data univariate and bivariate distributions, and improves performance for downstream tasks.

      "abstract": "Domain-generalized nuclei segmentation refers to the generalizability of models to unseen domains based on knowledge learned from source domains and is challenged by various image conditions, cell types, and stain strategies. Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has made great success in universal image segmentation by interactive prompt modes (e.g., point and box). Despite its strengths, the original SAM presents limited adaptation to medical images. Moreover, SAM requires providing manual bounding box prompts for each object to produce satisfactory segmentation masks, so it is laborious in nuclei segmentation scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a domain-generalizable framework for nuclei image segmentation, abbreviated to NuSegDG. Specifically, we first devise a Heterogeneous Space Adapter (HS-Adapter) to learn multi-dimensional feature representations of different nuclei domains by injecting a small number of trainable parameters into the image encoder of SAM. To alleviate the labor-intensive requirement of manual prompts, we introduce a Gaussian-Kernel Prompt Encoder (GKP-Encoder) to generate density maps driven by a single point, which guides segmentation predictions by mixing position prompts and semantic prompts. Furthermore, we present a Two-Stage Mask Decoder (TSM-Decoder) to effectively convert semantic masks to instance maps without the manual demand for morphological shape refinement. Based on our experimental evaluations, the proposed NuSegDG demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in nuclei instance segmentation, exhibiting superior domain generalization capabilities.

      "abstract": "Merging datasets across institutions is a lengthy and costly procedure, especially when it involves private information. Data hosts may therefore want to prospectively gauge which datasets are most beneficial to merge with, without revealing sensitive information. For causal estimation this is particularly challenging as the value of a merge depends not only on reduction in epistemic uncertainty but also on improvement in overlap. To address this challenge, we introduce the first cryptographically secure information-theoretic approach for quantifying the value of a merge in the context of heterogeneous treatment effect estimation. We do this by evaluating the Expected Information Gain (EIG) using multi-party computation to ensure that no raw data is revealed. We further demonstrate that our approach can be combined with differential privacy (DP) to meet arbitrary privacy requirements whilst preserving more accurate computation compared to DP alone. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first privacy-preserving method for dataset acquisition tailored to causal estimation. We demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of our method on a range of simulated and realistic benchmarks.

Our findings reveal a learning-without-mixing phenomenon, indicating that learning long-context linear autoregressive models is not hindered by slow mixing properties potentially associated with extended context windows. Additionally, we extend these results to (i) shared low-rank representations, where rank-regularized estimators improve the dependence of the rates on the dimensionality, and (ii) misspecified context lengths in strictly stable systems, where shorter contexts offer statistical advantages.",

      "abstract": "Estimating the variability of seasonal snow cover, in particular snow depth in remote areas, poses significant challenges due to limited spatial and temporal data availability. This study uses snow depth measurements from the ICESat-2 satellite laser altimeter, which are sparse in both space and time, and incorporates them with climate reanalysis data into a downscaling-calibration scheme to produce monthly gridded snow depth maps at microscale (10 m). Snow surface elevation measurements from ICESat-2 along profiles are compared to a digital elevation model to determine snow depth at each point. To efficiently turn sparse measurements into snow depth maps, a regression model is fitted to establish a relationship between the retrieved snow depth and the corresponding ERA5 Land snow depth. This relationship, referred to as subgrid variability, is then applied to downscale the monthly ERA5 Land snow depth data. The method can provide timeseries of monthly snow depth maps for the entire ERA5 time range (since 1950). The validation of downscaled snow depth data was performed at an intermediate scale (100 m x 500 m) using datasets from airborne laser scanning (ALS) in the Hardangervidda region of southern Norway. Results show that snow depth prediction achieved R2 values ranging from 0.74 to 0.88 (post-calibration). The method relies on globally available data and is applicable to other snow regions above the treeline. Though requiring area-specific calibration, our approach has the potential to provide snow depth maps in areas where no such data exist and can be used to extrapolate existing snow surveys in time and over larger areas. With this, it can offer valuable input data for hydrological, ecological or permafrost modeling tasks.",

      "abstract": "Sound event localization and detection (SELD) has seen substantial advancements through learning-based methods. These systems, typically trained from scratch on specific datasets, have shown considerable generalization capabilities. Recently, deep neural networks trained on large-scale datasets have achieved remarkable success in the sound event classification (SEC) field, prompting an open question of whether these advances can be extended to the development of SELD foundation models. In this paper, leveraging the power of pre-trained SEC models, we propose pre-trained SELD networks (PSELDNets) on a large-scale synthetic dataset. The synthetic dataset, generated by convolving sound events with simulated spatial room impulse responses (SRIRs), contains 1,167 hours of audio clips with an ontology of 170 sound classes. These PSELDNets are applied to various SELD scenarios. When we adapt PSELDNets to specific scenarios, particularly in cases of low-resource data, we introduce a data-efficient fine-tuning method, AdapterBit. PSELDNets are evaluated on synthetic-test-set using collected SRIRs from the TAU Spatial Room Impulse Response Database (TAU-SRIR DB) and achieve satisfactory performance. We also carried out experiments to validate the transferability of PSELDNets to three publicly available datasets and our own real-world recordings. The results demonstrate that PSELDNets surpass state-of-the-art systems across all publicly available datasets. Given the need for direction-of-arrival estimation, SELD generally relies on sufficient multi-channel audio clips. However, incorporating the AdapterBit, PSELDNets show more efficient adaptability to various scenarios using minimal multi-channel or even just monophonic audio clips, outperforming traditional fine-tuning approaches.",

      "abstract": "Tenure is a cornerstone of the US academic system, yet its relationship to faculty research trajectories remains poorly understood. Conceptually, tenure systems may act as a selection mechanism, screening in high-output researchers; a dynamic incentive mechanism, encouraging high output prior to tenure but low output after tenure; and a creative search mechanism, encouraging tenured individuals to undertake high-risk work. Here, we integrate data from seven different sources to trace US tenure-line faculty and their research outputs at an unprecedented scale and scope, covering over 12,000 researchers across 15 disciplines. Our analysis reveals that faculty publication rates typically increase sharply during the tenure track and peak just before obtaining tenure. Post-tenure trends, however, vary across disciplines: in lab-based fields, such as biology and chemistry, research output typically remains high post-tenure, whereas in non-lab-based fields, such as mathematics and sociology, research output typically declines substantially post-tenure. Turning to creative search, faculty increasingly produce novel, high-risk research after securing tenure. However, this shift toward novelty and risk-taking comes with a decline in impact, with post-tenure research yielding fewer highly cited papers. Comparing outcomes across common career ages but different tenure years or comparing research trajectories in tenure-based and non-tenure-based research settings underscores that breaks in the research trajectories are sharply tied to the individual's tenure year. Overall, these findings provide a new empirical basis for understanding the tenure system, individual research trajectories, and the shape of scientific output.",

      "abstract": "The stability of inverter-dominated power grids remains an active area of research. This paper presents novel sufficient conditions for ensuring small-signal stability in lossless and constant $R/X$ grids with highly heterogeneous mixes of grid-forming inverters that implement an adapted $V$-$q$ droop control. The proposed conditions can be evaluated in the neighborhood of each bus without information on the rest of the grid. Apart from the presence of $V$-$q$ droop, no additional assumptions are made regarding the inverter control strategies, nor is dynamical homogeneity across the system assumed. The analysis is enabled by recasting the node dynamics in terms of complex frequency and power, resulting in transfer functions that directly capture the small-signal frequency and amplitude responses to active and reactive power imbalances. These transfer functions are directly aligned with typical design considerations in grid-forming control. Building on an adapted small-phase theorem and viewing the system as a closed feedback loop between nodes and lines, the derived stability conditions also yield new insights when applied to established inverter control designs. We demonstrate in simulations that our conditions are not overly conservative and can identify individual inverters that are misconfigured and cause instability.",

This allows us to generate all cycle permutation graphs up to order $34$ and all permutation snarks up to order $46$, improving upon previous computational results by Brinkmann et al. Moreover, we give several improved lower bounds for interesting permutation snarks, such as for a smallest permutation snark of order $6 \\bmod 8$ or a smallest permutation snark of girth at least $6$ and give more evidence in support of a conjecture of Goddyn. These computational results also allow us to complete a characterisation of the orders for which non-hamiltonian cycle permutation graphs exist, answering an open question by Klee from 1972, and yield many more counterexamples to conjectures by Jackson and Zhang.",

      "abstract": "In the fifth-generation (5G) era, eliminating communication interference sources is crucial for maintaining network performance. Interference often originates from unauthorized or malfunctioning antennas, and radio monitoring agencies must address numerous sources of such antennas annually. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can improve inspection efficiency. However, the data transmission delay in the existing cloud-only (CO) artificial intelligence (AI) mode fails to meet the low latency requirements for real-time performance. Therefore, we propose a computer vision-based AI of Things (AIoT) system to detect antenna interference sources for UAVs. The system adopts an optimized edge-cloud collaboration (ECC+) mode, combining a keyframe selection algorithm (KSA), focusing on reducing end-to-end latency (E2EL) and ensuring reliable data transmission, which aligns with the core principles of ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). At the core of our approach is an end-to-end antenna localization scheme based on the tracking-by-detection (TBD) paradigm, including a detector (EdgeAnt) and a tracker (AntSort). EdgeAnt achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with a mean average precision (mAP) of 42.1% on our custom antenna interference source dataset, requiring only 3 million parameters and 14.7 GFLOPs. On the COCO dataset, EdgeAnt achieves 38.9% mAP with 5.4 GFLOPs. We deployed EdgeAnt on Jetson Xavier NX (TRT) and Raspberry Pi 4B (NCNN), achieving real-time inference speeds of 21.1 (1088) and 4.8 (640) frames per second (FPS), respectively. Compared with CO mode, the ECC+ mode reduces E2EL by 88.9%, increases accuracy by 28.2%. Additionally, the system offers excellent scalability for coordinated multiple UAVs inspections. The detector code is publicly available at https://github.com/SCNU-RISLAB/EdgeAnt.",

Although the empirical Bayes approach enables us to estimate the regularization parameter, little is known on the properties of the estimators. In particular, many aspects regarding the specific conditions under which the mechanism of automatic relevance determination (ARD) occurs remain unexplained. In this paper, we derive the empirical Bayes estimators for the group lasso regularized linear regression models with limited parameters. It is shown that the estimators diverge under a specific condition, giving rise to the ARD mechanism. We also prove that empirical Bayes methods can produce the ARD mechanism in general regularized linear regression models and clarify the conditions under which models such as ridge, lasso, and group lasso can do so.",

In 2024, Leo Versteegen obtained the celebrated proof of the Conjecture $\\frac{3}{5}$ on this variant of the domination game, proposed by Kinnersley, West and Zamani in 2013. In this paper, we investigate for the first time the normal play of the domination game, which we call \\textsc{Normal Domination Game}, that is an impartial game where the last to play wins. We first prove that this game is PSPACE-complete even in graphs with diameter two. We also use the Sprague-Grundy theory to prove that Alice (the first player) wins in the path $P_n$ if and only if $n$ is not a multiple of $4$, and wins in the cycle $C_n$ if and only if $n=4k+3$ for some integer $k$. Finally, we obtain a polynomial time algorithm to decide the winner for any disjoint union of paths and cycles in the \\textsc{Normal Domination Game} and its natural partizan variant.",

In this work, we present a black-box method for removing invisible image watermarks, without the need of any dataset of watermarked images or any knowledge about the watermark system. Our approach is simple to implement: given a single watermarked image, we regress it by deep image prior (DIP). We show that from the intermediate steps of DIP one can reliably find an evasion image that can remove invisible watermarks while preserving high image quality. Due to its unique working mechanism and practical effectiveness, we advocate including DIP as a baseline invasion method for benchmarking the robustness of watermarking systems. Finally, by showing the limited ability of DIP and other existing black-box methods in evading training-based visible watermarks, we discuss the positive implications on the practical use of training-based visible watermarks to prevent misinformation abuse.",

Additionally, we provide robust theoretical guarantees for DM, including a population theorem and an end-to-end sample theorem. The population theorem bridges the gap between the self-supervised learning task and target classification accuracy, while the sample theorem shows that, even with a limited number of samples from the target domain, DM can deliver exceptional classification performance, provided the unlabeled sample size is sufficiently large.",

      "abstract": "Melanoma is a malignant tumor that originates from skin cell lesions. Accurate and efficient segmentation of skin lesions is essential for quantitative analysis but remains a challenge due to blurred lesion boundaries, gradual color changes, and irregular shapes. To address this, we propose ScaleFusionNet, a hybrid model that integrates a Cross-Attention Transformer Module (CATM) and adaptive fusion block (AFB) to enhance feature extraction and fusion by capturing both local and global features. We introduce CATM, which utilizes Swin transformer blocks and Cross Attention Fusion (CAF) to adaptively refine feature fusion and reduce semantic gaps in the encoder-decoder to improve segmentation accuracy. Additionally, the AFB uses Swin Transformer-based attention and deformable convolution-based adaptive feature extraction to help the model gather local and global contextual information through parallel pathways. This enhancement refines the lesion boundaries and preserves fine-grained details. ScaleFusionNet achieves Dice scores of 92.94\\% and 91.80\\% on the ISIC-2016 and ISIC-2018 datasets, respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness in skin lesion analysis. Simultaneously, independent validation experiments were conducted on the PH$^2$ dataset using the pretrained model weights. The results show that ScaleFusionNet demonstrates significant performance improvements compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Our code implementation is publicly available at GitHub.",

      "abstract": "Background: Metacognition has gained significant attention for its potential to enhance autonomy and adaptability of artificial agents but remains a fragmented field: diverse theories, terminologies, and design choices have led to disjointed developments and limited comparability across systems. Existing overviews remain at a conceptual level that is undiscerning to the underlying algorithms, representations, and their respective success.\n  Methods: We address this gap by performing an explorative systematic review. Reports were included if they described techniques enabling Computational Metacognitive Architectures (CMAs) to model, store, remember, and process their episodic metacognitive experiences, one of Flavell's (1979a) three foundational components of metacognition. Searches were conducted in 16 databases, consulted between December 2023 and June 2024. Data were extracted using a 20-item framework considering pertinent aspects.\n  Results: A total of 101 reports on 35 distinct CMAs were included. Our findings show that metacognitive experiences may boost system performance and explainability, e.g., via self-repair. However, lack of standardization and limited evaluations may hinder progress: only 17% of CMAs were quantitatively evaluated regarding this review's focus, and significant terminological inconsistency limits cross-architecture synthesis. Systems also varied widely in memory content, data types, and employed algorithms.\n  Discussion: Limitations include the non-iterative nature of the search query, heterogeneous data availability, and an under-representation of emergent, sub-symbolic CMAs. Future research should focus on standardization and evaluation, e.g., via community-driven challenges, and on transferring promising principles to emergent architectures.",

      "abstract": "Quantum channel discrimination has been studied from an information-theoretic perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error probabilities as a function of the number of unknown channel accesses. In this paper, we study the query complexity of quantum channel discrimination, wherein the goal is to determine the minimum number of channel uses needed to reach a desired error probability. To this end, we show that the query complexity of binary channel discrimination depends logarithmically on the inverse error probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and Holevo) channel fidelity. As a special case of these findings, we precisely characterize the query complexity of discriminating two classical channels and two classical-quantum channels. Furthermore, by obtaining a tighter characterization of the sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing, including prior probabilities, we provide a more precise characterization of query complexity when the error probability does not exceed a fixed threshold. We also provide lower and upper bounds on the query complexity of binary asymmetric channel discrimination and multiple quantum channel discrimination. For the former, the query complexity depends on the geometric R\\'enyi and Petz R\\'enyi channel divergences, while for the latter, it depends on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and Uhlmann) channel fidelity. For multiple channel discrimination, the upper bound scales as the logarithm of the number of channels.",

      "abstract": "Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard for non-invasive cardiac assessment, offering rich spatio-temporal views of the cardiac anatomy and physiology. Patient-level health factors, such as demographics, metabolic, and lifestyle, are known to substantially influence cardiovascular health and disease risk, yet remain uncaptured by CMR alone. To holistically understand cardiac health and to enable the best possible interpretation of an individual's disease risk, CMR and patient-level factors must be jointly exploited within an integrated framework. Recent multi-modal approaches have begun to bridge this gap, yet they often rely on limited spatio-temporal data and focus on isolated clinical tasks, thereby hindering the development of a comprehensive representation for cardiac health evaluation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ViTa, a step toward foundation models that delivers a comprehensive representation of the heart and a precise interpretation of individual disease risk. Leveraging data from 42,000 UK Biobank participants, ViTa integrates 3D+T cine stacks from short-axis and long-axis views, enabling a complete capture of the cardiac cycle. These imaging data are then fused with detailed tabular patient-level factors, enabling context-aware insights. This multi-modal paradigm supports a wide spectrum of downstream tasks, including cardiac phenotype and physiological feature prediction, segmentation, and classification of cardiac and metabolic diseases within a single unified framework. By learning a shared latent representation that bridges rich imaging features and patient context, ViTa moves beyond traditional, task-specific models toward a universal, patient-specific understanding of cardiac health, highlighting its potential to advance clinical utility and scalability in cardiac analysis.",

The question of whether this variant provides an upper bound on the Shannon capacity of a graph was explicitly stated by Bi and Tang (2019). This letter presents an explicit example of a Tanner graph on 32 vertices, which shows that, in contrast to the Lov\\'{a}sz $\\vartheta$ function, this variant does not necessarily upper bound the Shannon capacity of a graph. The example, previously outlined by the author in a recent paper (2024), is presented here in full detail, making it easy to follow and verify. By resolving this question, the note clarifies a subtle but significant distinction between these two closely related graph invariants.",

This evolving intelligent assistant platform is equipped with chatbots and AI agents to help experts and guide non-experts in setting up and running the atomistic simulations, monitoring their computation status, analyzing the simulation results, and summarizing them for the user in text and graphical forms. We achieve these goals by exploiting open-source large language models (LLMs, original and fine-tuned), rule-based agents, and a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system. Aitomia leverages the versatility of our MLatom ecosystem, supporting AI-enhanced computational chemistry tasks ranging from ground- to excited-state calculations such as geometry optimizations, thermochemistry, and spectra calculations. Aitomia is the first intelligent assistant publicly accessible online on a cloud computing platform for atomistic simulations of broad scope (Aitomistic Hub at https://aitomistic.xyz), while it may also be deployed locally as described at http://mlatom.com/aitomia. Aitomia is expected to lower the barrier to performing atomistic simulations, democratizing simulations, and accelerating research and development in the relevant fields.",

No LLM inference mechanism can simultaneously achieve truthful response generation, semantic information conservation, relevant knowledge revelation, and knowledge-constrained optimality. This impossibility is fundamental, arising from the mathematical structure of information aggregation itself rather than engineering limitations. The proof spans three mathematical frameworks: auction theory, proper scoring theory for probabilistic predictions, and log-sum-exp analysis for transformer architectures. In each setting, we demonstrate that information aggregation creates unavoidable violations of conservation principles. The Jensen gap in transformer probability aggregation provides a direct measure of this impossibility. These results reframe hallucination from an engineering bug to an inevitable mathematical feature of distributed intelligence. There are fundamental trade-offs between truthfulness, knowledge utilization, and response completeness, providing principled foundations for managing rather than eliminating hallucination. This work reveals deep connections between neural network inference, philosophy of knowledge and reasoning, and classical results in game theory and information theory, opening new research directions for developing beneficial AI systems within mathematical constraints.",

      "abstract": "Parameterized quantum circuits represent promising architectures for machine learning applications, yet many lack clear connections to classical models, potentially limiting their ability to translate the wide success of classical neural networks to the quantum realm. We examine a specific type of quantum neural network (QNN) built exclusively from SWAP test circuits, and discuss its mathematical equivalence to a classical two-layer feedforward network with quadratic activation functions under amplitude encoding. Our analysis across classical real-world and synthetic datasets reveals that while this architecture can successfully learn many practical tasks, it exhibits fundamental expressivity limitations due to violating the universal approximation theorem, particularly failing on harder problems like the parity check function. To address this limitation, we introduce a circuit modification using generalized SWAP test circuits that effectively implements classical neural networks with product layers. This enhancement enables successful learning of parity check functions in arbitrary dimensions which we analytically argue to be impossible for the original architecture beyond two dimensions regardless of network size. Our results establish a framework for enhancing QNN expressivity through classical task analysis and demonstrate that our SWAP test-based architecture offers broad representational capacity, suggesting potential promise also for quantum learning tasks.",

      "abstract": "The organization and connectivity of the arcuate fasciculus (AF) in nonhuman primates remain contentious, especially concerning how its anatomy diverges from that of humans. Here, we combined cross-scale single-neuron tracing - using viral-based genetic labeling and fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography in macaques (n = 4; age 3 - 11 years) - with whole-brain tractography from 11.7T diffusion MRI. Complemented by spectral embedding analysis of 7.0T MRI in humans, we performed a comparative connectomic analysis of the AF across species. We demonstrate that the macaque AF originates in the temporal-parietal cortex, traverses the auditory cortex and parietal operculum, and projects into prefrontal regions. In contrast, the human AF exhibits greater expansion into the middle temporal gyrus and stronger prefrontal and parietal operculum connectivity - divergences quantified by Kullback-Leibler analysis that likely underpin the evolutionary specialization of human language networks. These interspecies differences - particularly the human AF's broader temporal integration and strengthened frontoparietal linkages - suggest a connectivity-based substrate for the emergence of advanced language processing unique to humans. Furthermore, our findings offer a neuroanatomical framework for understanding AF-related disorders such as aphasia and dyslexia, where aberrant connectivity disrupts language function.",

      "abstract": "We present Compressible Atmospheric Model-Network (CAM-NET), an AI model designed to predict neutral atmospheric variables from the Earth's surface to the ionosphere with high accuracy and computational efficiency. Accurate modeling of the entire atmosphere is critical for understanding the upward propagation of gravity waves, which influence upper-atmospheric dynamics and coupling across atmospheric layers. CAM-NET leverages the Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) to capture global-scale atmospheric dynamics while preserving the Earth's spherical structure. Trained on a decade of datasets from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere and ionosphere eXtension (WACCM-X), CAM-NET demonstrates accuracy comparable to WACCM-X while achieving a speedup of over 1000x in inference time, can provide one year simulation within a few minutes once trained. The model effectively predicts key atmospheric parameters, including zonal and meridional winds, temperature, and time rate of pressure. Inspired by traditional modeling approaches that use external couplers to simulate tracer transport, CAM-NET introduces a modular architecture that explicitly separates tracer prediction from core dynamics. The core backbone of CAM-NET focuses on forecasting primary physical variables (e.g., temperature, wind velocity), while tracer variables are predicted through a lightweight, fine-tuned model. This design allows for efficient adaptation to specific tracer scenarios with minimal computational cost, avoiding the need to retrain the entire model. We have validated this approach on the $O^2$ tracer, demonstrating strong performance and generalization capabilities.",

While these models excel at prediction, they are difficult to interpret and may fail to uncover useful relationships in the data. We propose an estimator to extract compact sets of decision rules from tree ensembles. The extracted models are accurate and can be manually examined to reveal relationships between the predictors and the response. A key novelty of our estimator is the flexibility to jointly control the number of rules extracted and the interaction depth of each rule, which improves accuracy. We develop a tailored exact algorithm to efficiently solve optimization problems underlying our estimator and an approximate algorithm for computing regularization paths, sequences of solutions that correspond to varying model sizes. We also establish novel non-asymptotic prediction error bounds for our proposed approach, comparing it to an oracle that chooses the best data-dependent linear combination of the rules in the ensemble subject to the same complexity constraint as our estimator. The bounds illustrate that the large-sample predictive performance of our estimator is on par with that of the oracle. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our estimator outperforms existing algorithms for rule extraction.",

This contribution introduces Wordkrill, a multidimensional extension of Wordfish that retains the original model's interpretability while allowing for efficient estimation of political positions along multiple latent dimensions. After presenting the mathematical framework of Wordkrill, its utility through brief applications to party manifestos and parliamentary speeches is demonstrated.

      "abstract": "Understanding the generalization abilities of neural networks for simple input-output distributions is crucial to account for their learning performance on real datasets. The classical teacher-student setting, where a network is trained from data obtained thanks to a label-generating teacher model, serves as a perfect theoretical test bed. In this context, a complete theoretical account of the performance of fully connected one-hidden layer networks in the presence of generic activation functions is lacking. In this work, we develop such a general theory for narrow networks, i.e. networks with a large number of hidden units, yet much smaller than the input dimension. Using methods from statistical physics, we provide closed-form expressions for the typical performance of both finite temperature (Bayesian) and empirical risk minimization estimators, in terms of a small number of weight statistics. In doing so, we highlight the presence of a transition where hidden neurons specialize when the number of samples is sufficiently large and proportional to the number of parameters of the network. Our theory accurately predicts the generalization error of neural networks trained on regression or classification tasks with either noisy full-batch gradient descent (Langevin dynamics) or full-batch gradient descent.",

      "abstract": "As the number of patients with heart failure increases, machine learning (ML) has garnered attention in cardiomyopathy diagnosis, driven by the shortage of pathologists. However, endomyocardial biopsy specimens are often small sample size and require techniques such as feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. This study aims to determine whether texture features are effective for feature extraction in the pathological diagnosis of cardiomyopathy. Furthermore, model designs that contribute toward improving generalization performance are examined by applying feature selection (FS) and dimensional compression (DC) to several ML models. The obtained results were verified by visualizing the inter-class distribution differences and conducting statistical hypothesis testing based on texture features. Additionally, they were evaluated using predictive performance across different model designs with varying combinations of FS and DC (applied or not) and decision boundaries. The obtained results confirmed that texture features may be effective for the pathological diagnosis of cardiomyopathy. Moreover, when the ratio of features to the sample size is high, a multi-step process involving FS and DC improved the generalization performance, with the linear kernel support vector machine achieving the best results. This process was demonstrated to be potentially effective for models with reduced complexity, regardless of whether the decision boundaries were linear, curved, perpendicular, or parallel to the axes. These findings are expected to facilitate the development of an effective cardiomyopathy diagnostic model for its rapid adoption in medical practice.",

We experiment with argument mining (AM) and argument pair extraction (APE), and evaluate the LLMs' ability to recognize arguments under progressively more abstract input and output (I/O) representations (e.g., arbitrary label sets, graphs, etc.). Unlike the well-known evaluation of prompt phrasings, abstraction evaluation retains the prompt's phrasing but tests reasoning capabilities. We find that scoring-wise the LLMs match or surpass the SOTA in AM and APE, and under certain I/O abstractions LLMs perform well, even beating chain-of-thought--we call this symbolic prompting. However, statistical analysis on the LLMs outputs when subject to small, yet still human-readable, alterations in the I/O representations (e.g., asking for BIO tags as opposed to line numbers) showed that the models are not performing reasoning. This suggests that LLM applications to some tasks, such as data labelling and paper reviewing, must be done with care.",

      "abstract": "Image captioning generates text that describes scenes from input images. It has been developed for high quality images taken in clear weather. However, in bad weather conditions, such as heavy rain, snow, and dense fog, the poor visibility owing to rain streaks, rain accumulation, and snowflakes causes a serious degradation of image quality. This hinders the extraction of useful visual features and results in deteriorated image captioning performance. To address practical issues, this study introduces a new encoder for captioning heavy rain images. The central idea is to transform output features extracted from heavy rain input images into semantic visual features associated with words and sentence context. To achieve this, a target encoder is initially trained in an encoder-decoder framework to associate visual features with semantic words. Subsequently, the objects in a heavy rain image are rendered visible by using an initial reconstruction subnetwork (IRS) based on a heavy rain model. The IRS is then combined with another semantic visual feature matching subnetwork (SVFMS) to match the output features of the IRS with the semantic visual features of the pretrained target encoder. The proposed encoder is based on the joint learning of the IRS and SVFMS. It is is trained in an end-to-end manner, and then connected to the pretrained decoder for image captioning. It is experimentally demonstrated that the proposed encoder can generate semantic visual features associated with words even from heavy rain images, thereby increasing the accuracy of the generated captions.",

      "abstract": "Generative modelling aims to accelerate the discovery of novel chemicals by directly proposing structures with desirable properties. Recently, score-based, or diffusion, generative models have significantly outperformed previous approaches. Key to their success is the close relationship between the score and physical force, allowing the use of powerful equivariant neural networks. However, the behaviour of the learnt score is not yet well understood. Here, we analyse the score by training an energy-based diffusion model for molecular generation. We find that during the generation the score resembles a restorative potential initially and a quantum-mechanical force at the end. In between the two endpoints, it exhibits special properties that enable the building of large molecules. Using insights from the trained model, we present Similarity-based Molecular Generation (SiMGen), a new method for zero shot molecular generation. SiMGen combines a time-dependent similarity kernel with descriptors from a pretrained machine learning force field to generate molecules without any further training. Our approach allows full control over the molecular shape through point cloud priors and supports conditional generation. We also release an interactive web tool that allows users to generate structures with SiMGen online (https://zndraw.icp.uni-stuttgart.de).",

However, most models currently used in chemistry are specialist models that require training and tuning for specific tasks. A more generic and efficient solution would be an AI model that could address many tasks and support free-form dialogue in the broad field of chemistry. In its utmost form, such a generalist AI chemist could be referred to as Chemical General Intelligence. Large language models (LLMs) have recently logged tremendous success in the general domain of natural language processing, showing emerging task generalization and free-form dialogue capabilities. However, domain knowledge of chemistry is largely missing when training general-domain LLMs. The lack of such knowledge greatly hinders the performance of generalist LLMs in the field of chemistry. To this end, we develop ChemDFM, a pioneering LLM for chemistry trained on 34B tokens from chemical literature and textbooks, and fine-tuned using 2.7M instructions. As a result, it can understand and reason with chemical knowledge in free-form dialogue. Quantitative evaluations show that ChemDFM significantly surpasses most representative open-source LLMs. It outperforms GPT-4 on a great portion of chemical tasks, despite the substantial size difference. We have open-sourced the inference codes, evaluation datasets, and model weights of ChemDFM on Huggingface (https://huggingface.co/OpenDFM/ChemDFM-v1.0-13B).",

      "abstract": "Graph anomaly detection (GAD) is a critical task in graph machine learning, with the primary objective of identifying anomalous nodes that deviate significantly from the majority. This task is widely applied in various real-world scenarios, including fraud detection and social network analysis. However, existing GAD methods still face two major challenges: (1) They are often limited to detecting anomalies in single-type interaction graphs and struggle with multiple interaction types in multiplex heterogeneous graphs. (2) In unsupervised scenarios, selecting appropriate anomaly score thresholds remains a significant challenge for accurate anomaly detection. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel Unsupervised Multiplex Graph Anomaly Detection method, named UMGAD. We first learn multi-relational correlations among nodes in multiplex heterogeneous graphs and capture anomaly information during node attribute and structure reconstruction through graph-masked autoencoder (GMAE). Then, to further extract abnormal information, we generate attribute-level and subgraph-level augmented-view graphs, respectively, and perform attribute and structure reconstruction through GMAE. Finally, we learn to optimize node attributes and structural features through contrastive learning between original-view and augmented-view graphs to improve the model's ability to capture anomalies. Meanwhile, we propose a new anomaly score threshold selection strategy, which allows the model to be independent of ground truth information in real unsupervised scenarios. Extensive experiments on six datasets show that our UMGAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving average improvements of 12.25% in AUC and 11.29% in Macro-F1 across all datasets.",

In this work we introduce CodeScientist, a novel ASD system that frames ideation and experiment construction as a form of genetic search jointly over combinations of research articles and codeblocks defining common actions in a domain (like prompting a language model). We use this paradigm to conduct hundreds of automated experiments on machine-generated ideas broadly in the domain of agents and virtual environments, with the system returning 19 discoveries, 6 of which were judged as being both at least minimally sound and incrementally novel after a multi-faceted evaluation beyond that typically conducted in prior work, including external (conference-style) review, code review, and replication attempts. Moreover, the discoveries span new tasks, agents, metrics, and data, suggesting a qualitative shift from benchmark optimization to broader discoveries.",

      "abstract": "Local-nonlocal coupling approaches provide a means to combine the computational efficiency of local models and the accuracy of nonlocal models. To facilitate the coupling of the two models, non-matching grids are often desirable as nonlocal grids usually require a finer resolution than local grids. In that case, it is often convenient to resort to interpolation operators so that models can exchange information in the overlap regions when nodes from the two grids do not coincide. This paper studies three existing coupling approaches, namely 1) a method that enforces matching displacements in an overlap region, 2) a variant that enforces a constraint on the stresses instead, and 3) a method that considers a variable horizon in the vicinity of the interfaces. The effect of the interpolation order and of the grid ratio on the performance of the three coupling methods with non-matching grids is carefully studied on one-dimensional examples using polynomial manufactured solutions. The numerical results show that the degree of the interpolants should be chosen with care to avoid introducing additional modeling errors, or simply minimize these errors, in the coupling approach.",

      "abstract": "Multi-band massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication can promote the cooperation of licensed and unlicensed spectra, effectively enhancing spectrum efficiency for Wi-Fi and other wireless systems. As an enabler for multi-band transmission, channel fingerprints (CF), also known as the channel knowledge map or radio environment map, are used to assist channel state information (CSI) acquisition and reduce computational complexity. In this paper, we propose CF-CGN (Channel Fingerprints with Cycle-consistent Generative Networks) to extrapolate CF for multi-band massive MIMO transmission where licensed and unlicensed spectra cooperate to provide ubiquitous connectivity. Specifically, we first model CF as a multichannel image and transform the extrapolation problem into an image translation task, which converts CF from one frequency to another by exploring the shared characteristics of statistical CSI in the beam domain. Then, paired generative networks are designed and coupled by variable-weight cycle consistency losses to fit the reciprocal relationship at different bands. Matched with the coupled networks, a joint training strategy is developed accordingly, supporting synchronous optimization of all trainable parameters. During the inference process, we also introduce a refining scheme to improve the extrapolation accuracy based on the resolution of CF. Numerical results illustrate that our proposed CF-CGN can achieve bidirectional extrapolation with an error of 5-17 dB lower than the benchmarks in different communication scenarios, demonstrating its excellent generalization ability. We further show that the sum rate performance assisted by CF-CGN-based CF is close to that with perfect CSI for multi-band massive MIMO transmission.",

      "abstract": "The prevailing deep learning-based methods of predicting cardiac segmentation involve reconstructed magnetic resonance (MR) images. The heavy dependency of segmentation approaches on image quality significantly limits the acceleration rate in fast MR reconstruction. Moreover, the practice of treating reconstruction and segmentation as separate sequential processes leads to artifact generation and information loss in the intermediate stage. These issues pose a great risk to achieving high-quality outcomes. To leverage the redundant k-space information overlooked in this dual-step pipeline, we introduce a novel approach to directly deriving segmentations from sparse k-space samples using a transformer (DiSK). DiSK operates by globally extracting latent features from 2D+time k-space data with attention blocks and subsequently predicting the segmentation label of query points. We evaluate our model under various acceleration factors (ranging from 4 to 64) and compare against two image-based segmentation baselines. Our model consistently outperforms the baselines in Dice and Hausdorff distances across foreground classes for all presented sampling rates.",

      "abstract": "The traveling purchaser problem (TPP) is an important combinatorial optimization problem with broad applications. Due to the coupling between routing and purchasing, existing works on TPPs commonly address route construction and purchase planning simultaneously, which, however, leads to exact methods with high computational cost and heuristics with sophisticated design but limited performance. In sharp contrast, we propose a novel approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which addresses route construction and purchase planning separately, while evaluating and optimizing the solution from a global perspective. The key components of our approach include a bipartite graph representation for TPPs to capture the market-product relations, and a policy network that extracts information from the bipartite graph and uses it to sequentially construct the route. One significant advantage of our framework is that we can efficiently construct the route using the policy network, and once the route is determined, the associated purchasing plan can be easily derived through linear programming, while, by leveraging DRL, we can train the policy network towards optimizing the global solution objective. Furthermore, by introducing a meta-learning strategy, the policy network can be trained stably on large-sized TPP instances, and generalize well across instances of varying sizes and distributions, even to much larger instances that are never seen during training. Experiments on various synthetic TPP instances and the TPPLIB benchmark demonstrate that our DRL-based approach can significantly outperform well-established TPP heuristics, reducing the optimality gap by 40%-90%, and also showing an advantage in runtime, especially on large-sized instances.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning is increasingly vital in cybersecurity, especially in malware detection. However, concept drift, where the characteristics of malware change over time, poses a challenge for maintaining the efficacy of these detection systems. Concept drift can occur in two forms: the emergence of entirely new malware families and the evolution of existing ones. This paper proposes an innovative method to address the former, focusing on effectively identifying new malware families. Our approach leverages a supervised autoencoder combined with triplet loss to differentiate between known and new malware families. We create clear and robust clusters that enhance the accuracy and resilience of malware family classification by utilizing this metric learning technique and the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm. The effectiveness of our method is validated using an Android malware dataset and a Windows portable executable (PE) malware dataset, showcasing its capability to sustain model performance within the dynamic landscape of emerging malware threats. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement in detecting new malware families, offering a reliable solution for ongoing cybersecurity challenges.",

Furthermore, the near proximity of electronic components makes power dissipation difficult, with the risk of not being able to control the temperature appropriately, reducing component lifetime and mission performance. To address this challenge, taking advantage of the advent of increasing intelligence on board satellites, an autonomous thermal control tool that uses deep reinforcement learning is proposed for learning the thermal control policy onboard. The tool was evaluated in a real space edge processing computer that will be used in a demonstration payload hosted in the International Space Station (ISS). The experiment results show that the proposed framework is able to learn to control the payload processing power to maintain the temperature under operational ranges, complementing traditional thermal control systems.",

Extensional knowledge provides information about the concrete instances that belong to specific concepts in the ontology, while intensional knowledge details inherent properties, characteristics, and semantic associations among concepts. However, existing ontology embedding approaches fail to take both extensional knowledge and intensional knowledge into fine consideration simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel ontology embedding approach named EIKE (Extensional and Intensional Knowledge Embedding) by representing ontologies in two spaces, called extensional space and intensional space. EIKE presents a unified framework for embedding instances, concepts and their relations in an ontology, applying a geometry-based method to model extensional knowledge and a pretrained language model to model intensional knowledge, which can capture both structure information and textual information. Experimental results show that EIKE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in three datasets for both triple classification and link prediction, indicating that EIKE provides a more comprehensive and representative perspective of the domain.",

      "abstract": "Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has become an essential method for building foundational visual models in remote sensing (RS). However, the limitations in size and diversity of existing RS datasets restrict the ability of MIM methods to learn generalizable representations. Additionally, conventional MIM techniques, which require reconstructing all tokens, introduce unnecessary computational overhead. To address these issues, we present a new pre-training pipeline for RS models, featuring the creation of a large-scale RS dataset and an efficient MIM approach. We curated a high-quality dataset named OpticalRS-13M by collecting publicly available RS datasets and processing them through exclusion, slicing, and deduplication. OpticalRS-13M comprises 13 million optical images covering various RS tasks, such as object detection and pixel segmentation. To enhance efficiency, we propose SelectiveMAE, a pre-training method that dynamically encodes and reconstructs semantically rich patch tokens, thereby reducing the inefficiencies of traditional MIM models caused by redundant background pixels in RS images. Extensive experiments show that OpticalRS-13M significantly improves classification, detection, and segmentation performance, while SelectiveMAE increases training efficiency over 2$\\times$ times. This highlights the effectiveness and scalability of our pipeline in developing RS foundational models. The dataset, source code, and trained models will be released at https://github.com/MiliLab/SelectiveMAE.",

To summarize the main argument in one sentence: If we consider all possible, intelligible, scientific models of ever-higher complexity, democratically, the predictions most favored by these complex models will agree with the predictions of the simplest models. This fact can be proven mathematically, thereby validating Occam's razor. Major parts of this line of reasoning have long preexisted within the depths of the algorithmic information theory literature, but they have always left room for doubts of various kinds. Therefore, we increase the generality, completeness, clarity, accessibility, and credibility of these arguments by countering over a dozen objections. We build our mathematical proof of Occam's razor on the shoulders of the exact 'chain rule' for Kolmogorov complexity.\n  Concerning physics, we then go on to diagnose the primary amendable root cause of the present stagnation of the research field of fundamental theoretical physics. We show that the effective antidote would consist in a practically feasible upgrade to the theoretical physicists' research methodology: When proposing new theoretical models, physicists should simply calculate and report the total amount of information that their models consist of. We explain why this methodology would be highly effective as well as how these calculations could be performed efficiently.",

      "abstract": "Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) have shown promising results in the field of medical diagnosis, which aims to provide support to medical professionals (doctor or pathologist). However, the ultimate decision regarding the diagnosis is made by the medical professional, drawing upon their accumulated experience. In this context, we believe that artificial intelligence can play a pivotal role in addressing the challenges in medical diagnosis not by making the final decision but by assisting in the diagnosis process with the most relevant information. The CBIR methods use similarity metrics to compare feature vectors generated from images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In addition to the information contained in medical images, clinical data about the patient is often available and is also relevant in the final decision-making process by medical professionals. In this paper, we propose a novel method named CBIDR, which leverage both medical images and clinical data of patient, combining them through the ranking algorithm TOPSIS. The goal is to aid medical professionals in their final diagnosis by retrieving images and clinical data of patient that are most similar to query data from the database. As a case study, we illustrate our CBIDR for diagnostic of oral cancer including histopathological images and clinical data of patient. Experimental results in terms of accuracy achieved 97.44% in Top-1 and 100% in Top-5 showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

In addition, we provide efficient distributed algorithms for computing all such functions assuming minimal or no knowledge about the network. Each of our algorithms comes in two versions: one that terminates with the correct output and a faster one that stabilizes on the correct output without explicit termination. Notably, these are the first deterministic algorithms whose running times scale linearly with both the number of processes and a parameter of the network which we call \"dynamic disconnectivity\" (meaning that our dynamic networks do not necessarily have to be connected at all times). We also provide matching lower bounds, showing that all our algorithms are asymptotically optimal for any fixed number of leaders.\n  While most of the existing literature on anonymous dynamic networks relies on classic mass-distribution techniques, our work makes use of a novel combinatorial structure called \"history tree\", which is of independent interest. Among other contributions, our results make conclusive progress on two popular fundamental problems for anonymous dynamic networks: leaderless Average Consensus (i.e., computing the mean value of input numbers distributed among the processes) and multi-leader Counting (i.e., determining the exact number of processes in the network).\n  Our contribution not only opens a promising line of research on applications of history trees, but also demonstrates that computation in anonymous dynamic networks is practically feasible and far less demanding than previously conjectured.",

In the absence of exact knowledge about the plant parameters and complete state measurements, the MPC optimization problem is reformulated in terms of their estimates derived from a suitably designed robust adaptive observer. The MPC routine returns a homothetic tube for the state estimate trajectory. Sets that characterize the state estimation errors are then added to the homothetic tube sections, resulting in a larger tube containing the true state trajectory. The two-tier tube architecture provides robustness to uncertainties due to imperfect parameter knowledge, external disturbances, and incomplete state information.

      "abstract": "In recent years, the underground economy is proliferating in the mobile system. These underground economy apps (UEware) make profits from providing non-compliant services, especially in sensitive areas such as gambling, pornography, and loans. Unlike traditional malware, most of them (over 80%) do not have malicious payloads. Due to their unique characteristics, existing detection approaches cannot effectively and efficiently mitigate this emerging threat.\n  To address this problem, we propose a novel approach to effectively and efficiently detect UEware by considering their UI transition graphs (UTGs). Based on the proposed approach, we design and implement a system named DeUEDroid to perform the detection. To evaluate DeUEDroid, we collect 25,717 apps and build the first large-scale ground-truth dataset (1,700 apps) of UEware. The evaluation result based on the ground-truth dataset shows that DeUEDroid can cover new UI features and statically construct precise UTG. It achieves 98.22% detection F1-score and 98.97% classification accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional approaches. The evaluation involving 24,017 apps demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of UEware detection in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, the result reveals that UEware are prevalent, with 54% of apps in the wild and 11% of apps in app stores being UEware. Our work sheds light on future work in analyzing and detecting UEware.",

While already providing great practical value, little is known about the actual prediction errors of MLIPs on adversarial structures and whether these errors can be controlled. We propose the Calibrated Adversarial Geometry Optimization (CAGO) algorithm to discover adversarial structures with user-assigned errors. Through uncertainty calibration, the estimated uncertainty of MLIPs is unified with real errors. By performing geometry optimization for calibrated uncertainty, we reach adversarial structures with the user-assigned target MLIP prediction error. Integrating with active learning pipelines, we benchmark CAGO, demonstrating stable MLIPs that systematically converge structural, dynamical, and thermodynamical properties for liquid water and water adsorption in a metal-organic framework within only hundreds of training structures, where previously many thousands were typically required.",

One of the characteristics of biological learning systems is their ability to learn in the presence of various noise sources. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a novel noise-based learning approach for physical systems implementing multi-layer neural networks. Simulation results show that our approach allows for effective learning whose performance approaches that of the conventional effective yet energy-costly backpropagation algorithm. Using a spintronics hardware implementation, we demonstrate experimentally that learning can be achieved in a small network composed of physical stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions.

Conventional $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-differential privacy, while prevalent, exhibits limited adaptability for many applications. To mitigate these constraints, we present alpha differential privacy (ADP), an innovative privacy framework grounded in alpha divergence, which provides a more flexible assessment of privacy consumption. This study delineates the theoretical underpinnings of ADP and contrasts its performance with competing privacy frameworks across many scenarios. Empirical assessments demonstrate that ADP offers enhanced privacy guarantees in small to moderate iteration contexts, particularly where severe privacy requirements are necessary. The suggested method markedly improves privacy-preserving methods, providing a flexible solution for contemporary data analysis issues in a data-centric environment.",

CleanUMamba leverages a U-Net encoder-decoder structure, incorporating the Mamba state-space model in the bottleneck layer. By replacing conventional self-attention and LSTM mechanisms with Mamba, our architecture offers superior denoising performance while maintaining a constant memory footprint, enabling streaming operation. To enhance efficiency, we applied structured channel pruning, achieving an 8X reduction in model size without compromising audio quality. Our model demonstrates strong results in the Interspeech 2020 Deep Noise Suppression challenge. Specifically, CleanUMamba achieves a PESQ score of 2.42 and STOI of 95.1% with only 442K parameters and 468M MACs, matching or outperforming larger models in real-time performance.

      "abstract": "Over the past decade, Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) has emerged as an efficient paradigm for the rapid and simultaneous quantification of multiple MRI parameters, including fat fraction (FF), water T1 ($T1_{H2O}$), water T2 ($T2_{H2O}$), and fat T1 ($T1_{fat}$). These parameters serve as promising imaging biomarkers in various anatomical targets such as the heart, liver, and skeletal muscles. However, measuring these parameters in the upper body poses challenges due to physiological motion, particularly respiratory motion. In this work, we propose a novel approach, motion-corrected (MoCo) MRF T1-FF, which estimates the motion field using an optimized preliminary motion scan and uses it to correct the MRF acquisition data before dictionary search for reconstructing motion-corrected FF and $T1_{H2O}$ parametric maps of the upper-body region. We validated this framework using an $\\textit{in vivo}$ dataset comprising ten healthy volunteers and a 10-year-old boy with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. At the ROI level, in regions minimally affected by motion, no significant bias was observed between the uncorrected and MoCo reconstructions for FF (mean difference of -0.7%) and $T1_{H2O}$ (-4.9 ms) values. Moreover, MoCo MRF T1-FF significantly reduced the standard deviations of distributions assessed in these regions, indicating improved precision. Notably, in regions heavily affected by motion, such as respiratory muscles, liver, and kidneys, the MRF parametric maps exhibited a marked reduction in motion blurring and streaking artifacts after motion correction. Furthermore, the diaphragm was consistently discernible on parametric maps after motion correction. This approach lays the groundwork for the joint 3D quantification of FF and $T1_{H2O}$ in regions that are rarely studied, such as the respiratory muscles, particularly the intercostal muscles and diaphragm.",

      "abstract": "Epileptic seizures cause abnormal brain activity, and their unpredictability can lead to accidents, underscoring the need for long-term seizure prediction. Although seizures can be predicted by analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, existing methods often require too many electrode channels or larger models, limiting mobile usability. This paper introduces a SlimSeiz framework that utilizes adaptive channel selection with a lightweight neural network model. SlimSeiz operates in two states: the first stage selects the optimal channel set for seizure prediction using machine learning algorithms, and the second stage employs a lightweight neural network based on convolution and Mamba for prediction. On the Children's Hospital Boston-MIT (CHB-MIT) EEG dataset, SlimSeiz can reduce channels from 22 to 8 while achieving a satisfactory result of 94.8% accuracy, 95.5% sensitivity, and 94.0% specificity with only 21.2K model parameters, matching or outperforming larger models' performance. We also validate SlimSeiz on a new EEG dataset, SRH-LEI, collected from Shanghai Renji Hospital, demonstrating its effectiveness across different patients. The code and SRH-LEI dataset are available at https://github.com/guoruilu/SlimSeiz.",

      "abstract": "Passive Acoustic Monitoring is a key tool for biodiversity conservation, but the large volumes of unsupervised audio it generates present major challenges for extracting meaningful information. Deep Learning offers promising solutions. BirdNET, a widely used bird identification model, has shown success in many study systems but is limited at local scale due to biases in its training data, which focus on specific locations and target sounds rather than entire soundscapes. A key challenge in bird species identification is that many recordings either lack target species or contain overlapping vocalizations, complicating automatic identification. To address these problems, we developed a multi-stage pipeline for automatic bird vocalization identification in Do\\~nana National Park (SW Spain), a wetland of high conservation concern. We deployed AudioMoth recorders in three main habitats across nine locations and manually annotated 461 minutes of audio, resulting in 3749 labeled segments spanning 34 classes. We first applied a Bird Song Detector to isolate bird vocalizations using spectrogram-based image processing. Then, species were classified using custom models trained at the local scale. Applying the Bird Song Detector before classification improved species identification, as all models performed better when analyzing only the segments where birds were detected. Specifically, the combination of detector and fine-tuned BirdNET outperformed the baseline without detection. This approach demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating a Bird Song Detector with local classification models. These findings highlight the need to adapt general-purpose tools to specific ecological challenges. Automatically detecting bird species helps track the health of this threatened ecosystem, given birds sensitivity to environmental change, and supports conservation planning to reduce biodiversity loss.",

Recently, purely vision-based solutions have gained increasing research interest. In particular, approaches extracting a bird's eye view (BEV) from multiple cameras have demonstrated great performance for spatial understanding. This paper addresses the dependency on learned positional encodings to correlate image and BEV feature map elements for transformer-based methods. We propose leveraging epipolar geometric constraints to model the relationship between cameras and the BEV by Epipolar Attention Fields. They are incorporated into the attention mechanism as a novel attribution term, serving as an alternative to learned positional encodings. Experiments show that our method EAFormer outperforms previous BEV approaches by 2% mIoU for map semantic segmentation and exhibits superior generalization capabilities compared to implicitly learning the camera configuration.",

      "abstract": "Deep neural network architectures often consist of repetitive structural elements. We introduce an approach that reveals these patterns and can be broadly applied to the study of deep learning. Similarly to how a power strip helps untangle and organize complex cable connections, this approach treats neurons as additional degrees of freedom in interactions, simplifying the structure and enhancing the intuitive understanding of interactions within deep neural networks. Furthermore, it reveals the translational symmetry of deep neural networks, which simplifies the application of the renormalization group transformation-a method that effectively analyzes the scaling behavior of the system. By utilizing translational symmetry and renormalization group transformations, we can analyze critical phenomena. This approach may open new avenues for studying deep neural networks using statistical physics.",

In this paper, we establish the Graph Level Order (GLOVER) data structure, which orders the nodes by shortest path from a minimum out-degree node and establishes a well-ordering of rooted neighborhoods. This data structure allows for the construction of decreasing sequences of subsets of nodes and allows us to partition transitive triangles into distinct sets. The decreasing sequence of nodes shows the non-existence of counterexamples to the SSNC and precisely identifies a path to the required node. Further, our algorithmic approach finds the occurrence of dense graphs inside the rooted neighborhoods. Beyond theoretical implications, the algorithm and data structure have practical applications in data science, network optimization and algorithm design.",

G{\\\"a}rdenfors' conceptual spaces is a prominent framework for understanding human representations. Convexity of object regions in conceptual spaces is argued to promote generalizability, few-shot learning, and interpersonal alignment. Based on these insights, we investigate the notion of convexity of concept regions in machine-learned latent spaces. We develop a set of tools for measuring convexity in sampled data and evaluate emergent convexity in layered representations of state-of-the-art deep networks. We show that convexity is robust to basic re-parametrization and, hence, meaningful as a quality of machine-learned latent spaces. We find that approximate convexity is pervasive in neural representations in multiple application domains, including models of images, audio, human activity, text, and medical images. Generally, we observe that fine-tuning increases the convexity of label regions. We find evidence that pretraining convexity of class label regions predicts subsequent fine-tuning performance.",

      "abstract": "Due to large intra-subject and inter-subject variabilities of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) usually need subject-specific calibration to tailor the decoding algorithm for each new subject, which is time-consuming and user-unfriendly, hindering their real-world applications. Transfer learning (TL) has been extensively used to expedite the calibration, by making use of EEG data from other subjects/sessions. An important consideration in TL for EEG-based BCIs is to reduce the data distribution discrepancies among different subjects/sessions, to avoid negative transfer. Euclidean alignment (EA) was proposed in 2020 to address this challenge. Numerous experiments from 13 different BCI paradigms demonstrated its effectiveness and efficiency. This paper revisits EA, explaining its procedure and correct usage, introducing its applications and extensions, and pointing out potential new research directions. It should be very helpful to BCI researchers, especially those who are working on EEG signal decoding.",

This study compared two touchless methods for directing mobile robots: voice control and gesture control, to investigate the efficiency of the methods and the preference of users. We tested these methods in two conditions: one in which participants remained stationary and one in which they walked freely alongside the robot. We hypothesized that walking alongside the robot would result in higher intuitiveness ratings and improved task performance, based on the idea that walking promotes spatial alignment and reduces the effort required for mental rotation. In a 2x2 within-subject design, 218 participants guided the quadruped robot Spot along a circuitous route with multiple 90-degree turns using rotate left, rotate right, and walk forward commands. After each trial, participants rated the intuitiveness of the command mapping, while post-experiment interviews were used to gather the participants' preferences. Results showed that voice control combined with walking with Spot was the most favored and intuitive, whereas gesture control while standing caused confusion for left/right commands. Nevertheless, 29% of participants preferred gesture control, citing increased task engagement and visual congruence as reasons. An odometry-based analysis revealed that participants often followed behind Spot, particularly in the gesture control condition, when they were allowed to walk. In conclusion, voice control with walking produced the best outcomes. Improving physical ergonomics and adjusting gesture types could make gesture control more effective.",

      "abstract": "Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging serves as the gold-standard for evaluating cardiac morphology and function. Typically, a multi-view CMR stack, covering short-axis (SA) and 2/3/4-chamber long-axis (LA) views, is acquired for a thorough cardiac assessment. However, efficiently streamlining the complex, high-dimensional 3D+T CMR data and distilling compact, coherent representation remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce a whole-heart self-supervised learning framework that utilizes masked imaging modeling to automatically uncover the correlations between spatial and temporal patches throughout the cardiac stacks. This process facilitates the generation of meaningful and well-clustered heart representations without relying on the traditionally required, and often costly, labeled data. The learned heart representation can be directly used for various downstream tasks. Furthermore, our method demonstrates remarkable robustness, ensuring consistent representations even when certain CMR planes are missing/flawed. We train our model on 14,000 unlabeled CMR data from UK BioBank and evaluate it on 1,000 annotated data. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance to baselines in tasks that demand comprehensive 3D+T cardiac information, e.g. cardiac phenotype (ejection fraction and ventricle volume) prediction and multi-plane/multi-frame CMR segmentation, highlighting its effectiveness in extracting comprehensive cardiac features that are both anatomically and pathologically relevant.",

This paper presents MicroViT, a lightweight Vision Transformer architecture optimized for edge devices by significantly reducing computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy. The core of MicroViT is the Efficient Single Head Attention (ESHA) mechanism, which utilizes group convolution to reduce feature redundancy and processes only a fraction of the channels, thus lowering the burden of the self-attention mechanism. MicroViT is designed using a multi-stage MetaFormer architecture, stacking multiple MicroViT encoders to enhance efficiency and performance. Comprehensive experiments on the ImageNet-1K and COCO datasets demonstrate that MicroViT achieves competitive accuracy while significantly improving 3.6 faster inference speed and reducing energy consumption with 40% higher efficiency than the MobileViT series, making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments such as mobile and edge devices.",

      "abstract": "With the impressive growth of network models in practically every scientific and technological area, we are often faced with the need to compare graphs, i.e., to quantify their (dis)similarity using appropriate metrics. This is necessary, for example, to identify networks with comparable characteristics or to spot anomalous instants in a time sequence of graphs. While a large number of metrics are available for binary networks, the set of comparison methods capable of handling weighted graphs is much smaller. Yet, the strength of connections is often a key ingredient of the model, and ignoring this information could lead to misleading results. In this paper we introduce a family of dissimilarity measures to compare undirected weighted networks. They fall into the class of alignment-free metrics: as such, they do not require the correspondence of the nodes between the two graphs and can also compare networks of different sizes. In short, they are based on the distributions, on the graph, of a few egonet features which are easily defined and computed: the distance between two graphs is then the distance between the corresponding distributions. On a properly defined testbed with a pool of weighted network models with diversified characteristics, the proposed metrics are shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in the model classification task. The effectiveness and applicability of the proposed metrics are then demonstrated on two examples. In the first, some \"filtering\" schemes -- designed to eliminate non-significant links while maintaining most of the total weight -- are evaluated in their ability to produce as output a graph faithful to the original, in terms of the local structure around nodes. In the second example, analyzing a timeline of stock market correlation graphs highlights anomalies associated with periods of financial instability.",

As such, comments provide valuable insights into developers' understanding of their code and describe their various intentions in writing the surrounding code. Recent research leverages natural language processing and deep learning to classify comments based on developers' intentions. However, such labelled data are often imbalanced, causing learning models to perform poorly. This work investigates the use of different weighting strategies of the loss function to mitigate the scarcity of certain classes in the dataset. In particular, various RoBERTa-based transformer models are fine-tuned by means of a hyperparameter search to identify their optimal parameter configurations. Additionally, we fine-tuned the transformers with different weighting strategies for the loss function to address class imbalances. Our approach outperforms the STACC baseline by 8.9 per cent on the NLBSE'25 Tool Competition dataset in terms of the average F1$_c$ score, and exceeding the baseline approach in 17 out of 19 cases with a gain ranging from -5.0 to 38.2.

      "abstract": "Metal additive manufacturing via laser-based powder bed fusion (PBF-LB/M) faces performance-critical challenges due to complex melt pool and vapor dynamics, often oversimplified by computational models that neglect crucial aspects, such as vapor jet formation. To address this limitation, we propose a consistent computational multi-physics mesoscale model to study melt pool dynamics, laser-induced evaporation, and vapor flow. In addition to the evaporation-induced pressure jump, we also resolve the evaporation-induced volume expansion and the resulting velocity jump at the liquid--vapor interface. We use an anisothermal incompressible Navier--Stokes solver extended by a conservative diffuse level-set framework and integrate it into a matrix-free adaptive finite element framework. To ensure accurate physical solutions despite extreme density, pressure and velocity gradients across the diffuse liquid--vapor interface, we employ consistent interface source term formulations developed in our previous work. These formulations consider projection operations to extend solution variables from the sharp liquid--vapor interface into the computational domain. Benchmark examples, including film boiling, confirm the accuracy and versatility of the model. As a key result, we demonstrate the model's ability to capture the strong coupling between melt and vapor flow dynamics in PBF-LB/M based on simulations of stationary laser illumination on a metal plate. Additionally, we show the derivation of the well-known Anisimov model and extend it to a new hybrid model. This hybrid model, together with consistent interface source term formulations, especially for the level-set transport velocity, enables PBF-LB/M simulations that combine accurate physical results with the robustness of an incompressible, diffuse-interface computational modeling framework.",

Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) are comments in the code that indicate not-quite-right code introduced for short-term needs, i.e., technical debt (TD). Previous research has provided evidence of a possible relationship between SATD and the existence of vulnerabilities in the code. In this work, we investigate if multi-task learning could leverage the information shared between SATD and vulnerabilities to improve the automatic detection of these issues. To this aim, we implemented VulSATD, a deep learner that detects vulnerable and SATD code based on CodeBERT, a pre-trained transformers model. We evaluated VulSATD on MADE-WIC, a fused dataset of functions annotated for TD (through SATD) and vulnerability. We compared the results using single and multi-task approaches, obtaining no significant differences even after employing a weighted loss. Our findings indicate the need for further investigation into the relationship between these two aspects of low-quality code. Specifically, it is possible that only a subset of technical debt is directly associated with security concerns. Therefore, the relationship between different types of technical debt and software vulnerabilities deserves future exploration and a deeper understanding.",

The bounding box and pure foreground/background labels, generated from the point annotation, guarantee the rationality of the prediction in the arrangement of target localization and the spatial distribution of target/background regions, respectively.

      "abstract": "The success of social media platforms has facilitated the emergence of various forms of online abuse within digital communities. This abuse manifests in multiple ways, including hate speech, cyberbullying, emotional abuse, grooming, and sexting. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the different forms of abuse prevalent in social media, with a particular focus on how emerging technologies, such as Language Models (LMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), are reshaping both the detection and generation of abusive content within these networks. We delve into the mechanisms through which social media abuse is perpetuated, exploring the psychological and social impact. Additionally, we examine the dual role of advanced language models-highlighting their potential to enhance automated detection systems for abusive behavior while also acknowledging their capacity to generate harmful content. This paper aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on online safety and ethics, offering insights into the evolving landscape of cyberabuse and the technological innovations that both mitigate and exacerbate it.",
