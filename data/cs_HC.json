      "abstract": "The goal of this study is to identify factors that support and enhance older adults' creative experiences in human-robot co-creativity. Because the research into the use of robots for creativity support with older adults remains underexplored, we carried out an exploratory case study. We took a participatory approach and collaborated with professional art educators to design a course Drawing with Robots for adults aged 65 and over. The course featured human-human and human-robot drawing activities with various types of robots. We observed collaborative drawing interactions, interviewed participants on their experiences, and analyzed collected data. Findings show that participants preferred acting as curators, evaluating creative suggestions from the robot in a teacher or coach role. When we enhanced a robot with a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM), participants appreciated its spoken dialogue capabilities. They reported however, that the robot's feedback sometimes lacked an understanding of the context, and sensitivity to their artistic goals and preferences. Our findings highlight the potential of LLM-enhanced robots to support creativity and offer future directions for advancing human-robot co-creativity with older adults.",

While previous research has focused on developing external Human-Machine Interfaces (eHMIs) to facilitate these interactions, we argue that involving users in the early creative stages can help address key challenges in the development of this technology. To explore this, our study adopts a participatory, crowd-sourced approach to gather user-generated ideas for eHMI designs. Participants were first introduced to fundamental eHMI concepts, equipping them to sketch their own design ideas in response to scenarios with varying levels of perceived risk. An initial pre-study with 29 participants showed that while they actively engaged in the process, there was a need to refine task objectives and encourage deeper reflection. To address these challenges, a follow-up study with 50 participants was conducted. The results revealed a strong preference for autonomous vehicles to communicate their awareness and intentions using lights (LEDs and projections), symbols, and text. Participants' sketches prioritized multi-modal communication, directionality, and adaptability to enhance clarity, consistently integrating familiar vehicle elements to improve intuitiveness.",

Unlike existing methods that rely on handcrafted heuristics or domain-specific rules, CODS provides a generalizable and interpretable framework that supports diverse design tasks. Given a user requirement and a well-defined design space, CODS automatically derives soft and hard constraints using large language models through a structured prompt engineering pipeline. These constraints guide the optimization process to generate design solutions that are coherent, expressive, and aligned with user intent. We validate our approach across two domains-visualization design and knitwear generation-demonstrating superior performance in design quality, intent alignment, and user preference compared to existing LLM-based methods. CODS offers a unified foundation for scalable, controllable, and AI-powered design automation.",

This has created a need to develop an overarching understanding of common worker-driven patterns around these transformations. To fill this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review of 23 studies from the ACM Digital Library that focused on workers' lived-experiences and practitioners with GenAI. Our findings reveal that while many professionals have delegated routine tasks to GenAI to focus on core responsibilities, they have also taken on new forms of AI managerial labor to monitor and refine GenAI outputs. Additionally, practitioners have restructured collaborations, sometimes bypassing traditional peer and subordinate interactions in favor of GenAI assistance. These shifts have fragmented cohesive tasks into piecework creating tensions around role boundaries and professional identity. Our analysis suggests that current frameworks, like job crafting, need to evolve to address the complexities of GenAI-driven transformations.",

These tools exist in various forms, from commercially available pedals and software to custom-built systems, each employing different methods to generate harmonies. Traditional harmonizers often require users to manually specify a key or tonal center, while others allow pitch selection via an external keyboard-both approaches demanding some degree of musical expertise. The AI Harmonizer introduces a novel approach by autonomously generating musically coherent four-part harmonies without requiring prior harmonic input from the user. By integrating state-of-the-art generative AI techniques for pitch detection and voice modeling with custom-trained symbolic music models, our system arranges any vocal melody into rich choral textures. In this paper, we present our methods, explore potential applications in performance and composition, and discuss future directions for real-time implementations. While our system currently operates offline, we believe it represents a significant step toward AI-assisted vocal performance and expressive musical augmentation. We release our implementation on GitHub.",

To study this effect, we introduce a Bayesian framework in which heterogeneous users choose how much information to share with the AI, facing a trade-off between output fidelity and communication cost. We show that the interplay between these individual-level decisions and AI training may lead to societal challenges. Outputs may become more homogenized, especially when the AI is trained on AI-generated content, potentially triggering a homogenization death spiral. And any AI bias may propagate to become societal bias. A solution to the homogenization and bias issues is to reduce human-AI interaction frictions and enable users to flexibly share information, leading to personalized outputs without sacrificing productivity.",

Rather than passively accepting output, users actively refine, explore, and co-construct text. We conduct a large-scale analysis of this collaborative behavior for users engaged in writing tasks in the wild with two popular AI assistants, Bing Copilot and WildChat. Our analysis goes beyond simple task classification or satisfaction estimation common in prior work and instead characterizes how users interact with LLMs through the course of a session. We identify prototypical behaviors in how users interact with LLMs in prompts following their original request. We refer to these as Prototypical Human-AI Collaboration Behaviors (PATHs) and find that a small group of PATHs explain a majority of the variation seen in user-LLM interaction. These PATHs span users revising intents, exploring texts, posing questions, adjusting style or injecting new content. Next, we find statistically significant correlations between specific writing intents and PATHs, revealing how users' intents shape their collaboration behaviors. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings on LLM alignment.",

This dissertation examines how individuals and institutions are adapting to and engaging with this emerging technology through three research directions. First, I demonstrate how the institutional adoption of AI detectors introduces systematic biases, particularly disadvantaging writers of non-dominant language varieties, highlighting critical equity concerns in AI governance. Second, I present novel population-level algorithmic approaches that measure the increasing adoption of LLMs across writing domains, revealing consistent patterns of AI-assisted content in academic peer reviews, scientific publications, consumer complaints, corporate communications, job postings, and international organization press releases. Finally, I investigate LLMs' capability to provide feedback on research manuscripts through a large-scale empirical analysis, offering insights into their potential to support researchers who face barriers in accessing timely manuscript feedback, particularly early-career researchers and those from under-resourced settings.",
