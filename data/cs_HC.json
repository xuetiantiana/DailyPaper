      "abstract": "Data visualization tasks often require multi-step reasoning, and the interpretive strategies experts use, such as decomposing complex goals into smaller subtasks and selectively attending to key chart regions are rarely made explicit. ViStruct is an automated pipeline that simulates these expert behaviours by breaking high-level visual questions into structured analytic steps and highlighting semantically relevant chart areas. Leveraging large language and vision-language models, ViStruct identifies chart components, maps subtasks to spatial regions, and presents visual attention cues to externalize expert-like reasoning flows. While not designed for direct novice instruction, ViStruct provides a replicable model of expert interpretation that can inform the development of future visual literacy tools. We evaluate the system on 45 tasks across 12 chart types and validate its outputs with trained visualization users, confirming its ability to produce interpretable and expert-aligned reasoning sequences.",

      "abstract": "Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many professional entities shifted toward remote collaboration and video conferencing (VC) tools. Social virtual reality (VR) platforms present an alternative to VC for meetings and collaborative activities. Well-crafted social VR environments could enhance feelings of co-presence and togetherness at meetings, helping reduce the need for carbon-intensive travel to face-to-face meetings. This research contributes to creating meeting tools in VR by exploring the effects of avatar styles and virtual environments on groups creative performance using the Mozilla Hubs platform. We present the results of two sequential studies. Study One surveys avatar and environment preferences in various VR meeting contexts (N=87). Study Two applies these findings to the design of a between-subjects and within-subjects research where participants (N=40) perform creativity tasks in pairs as embodied avatars in different virtual settings using VR headsets. We discuss the design implications of avatar appearances and meeting settings on teamwork.",

      "abstract": "Despite advances in surgical techniques and care, postoperative complications are prevalent and effects up to 15% of the patients who underwent a major surgery. The objective of this study is to develop and validate models for predicting postoperative complications and death after major surgery on a large and multicenter dataset, following the previously validated MySurgeryRisk algorithm. This retrospective, longitudinal and multicenter cohort analysis included 508,097 encounters from 366,875 adult inpatients who underwent major surgeries and were admitted to healthcare institutions within the OneFlorida+ network between 01/01/2012 and 04/29/2023. We applied the validated feature selection and transformation approach in MySurgeryRisk models and redeveloped eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models for predicting risk of postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI), need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission, need for mechanical ventilation (MV) therapy and in-hospital mortality on a development set and evaluated the model performance on a validation set. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve values were obtained for need for ICU admission, 0.93 (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 0.93-0.93); need for MV, 0.94 (95% CI, 0.94-0.94); AKI, 0.92 (95% CI, 0.92-0.92); and in-hospital mortality, 0.95 (95% CI, 0.94-0.95). Area under the precision-recall curve values were computed for need for ICU admission, 0.62 (95% CI, 0.62-0.63); need for MV, 0.51 (95% CI, 0.49-0.52); AKI, 0.53 (95% CI, 0.53-0.54); and in-hospital mortality, 0.26 (95% CI, 0.24-0.29). The performance of these models is comparable to that of the previously validated MySurgeryRisk models, suggesting the enhanced generalizability of the models. Primary procedure code and provider specialty consistently appeared as the top influential variables, providing valuable insights into the factors influencing surgical outcomes.",

      "abstract": "The current apprenticeship model for surgical training requires a high level of supervision, which does not scale well to meet the growing need for more surgeons. Many endoscopic procedures are directly taught in the operating room (OR) while the attending surgeon and trainee operate on patients. The need to prioritize patient care limits the trainees' opportunities to experiment and receive feedback on their performance. Augmented reality (AR) has the potential to increase efficiency in endoscopic surgical training, but additional research is critical to understanding the needs of surgical trainees to inform the design of AR training systems. Therefore, we worked with 18 surgical trainees to understand the strengths, limitations, and unmet needs of their current training environment and to co-design an AR eye-gaze tracking system based on their preferences. Trainees emphasized the need to practice the 2D to 3D mapping needed to properly familiarize oneself with the anatomy of patients to prepare for real surgery. The trainees felt that an AR-based eye gaze tracking system would be a useful supplemental training method that would improve their learning in OR cases without detracting from patient care. To tailor the AR system to their needs, they co-designed features to improve their ability to track the attending surgeon's eye gaze and to provide a real-time, interactive system. Our results are valuable in shaping the endoscopic training modules by generating user-informed guidelines to design future collaborative AR-based eye-gaze tracking systems.",

This study examines how gender-diverse populations perceive bias, accuracy, and trustworthiness in LLMs, specifically ChatGPT. Through 25 in-depth interviews with non-binary/transgender, male, and female participants, we investigate how gendered and neutral prompts influence model responses and how users evaluate these responses. Our findings reveal that gendered prompts elicit more identity-specific responses, with non-binary participants particularly susceptible to condescending and stereotypical portrayals. Perceived accuracy was consistent across gender groups, with errors most noted in technical topics and creative tasks. Trustworthiness varied by gender, with men showing higher trust, especially in performance, and non-binary participants demonstrating higher performance-based trust. Additionally, participants suggested improving the LLMs by diversifying training data, ensuring equal depth in gendered responses, and incorporating clarifying questions. This research contributes to the CSCW/HCI field by highlighting the need for gender-diverse perspectives in LLM development in particular and AI in general, to foster more inclusive and trustworthy systems.",

Then, we introduce AnyAni, a human-AI collaborative system that supports front-end developers in the ideation, manipulation, and implementation of animation effects. The system combines the assistance of generative AI in creative design by adopting a nonlinear workflow for iterative animation development. In addition, developers can understand and learn the code generated for implementing animations through various interactive methods.

This paper presents a phased methodological approach to building cognitive monitoring systems for such environments. By integrating insights from human factors research, simulation-based training, sensor technologies, and fundamental psychological principles, the proposed framework supports real-time performance assessment with minimum intrusion. The approach begins with simplified simulations and evolves towards operational contexts. Key challenges addressed include variability in workload, the effects of fatigue and stress, thus the need for adaptive monitoring for early warning support mechanisms. The methodology aims to improve situational awareness, reduce human error, and support decision-making without undermining operator autonomy. Ultimately, the work contributes to the development of resilient and transparent systems in domains where human performance is critical to safety.",

      "abstract": "Hybrid collaboration has become a fixture in modern workplaces, yet it introduces persistent socio-technical asymmetries-especially disadvantaging remote participants, who struggle with presence disparity, reduced visibility, and limited non-verbal communication. Traditional solutions often seek to erase these asymmetries, but recent research suggests embracing them as productive design constraints. In this context, we introduce NoticeLight: a tangible, peripheral robotic embodiment designed to augment hybrid meetings. NoticeLight transforms remote participants' digital presence into ambient, physical signals -- such as mood dynamics, verbal contribution mosaics, and attention cues -- within the co-located space. By abstracting group states into subtle light patterns, NoticeLight fosters peripheral awareness and balanced participation without disrupting meeting flow or demanding cognitive overload. This approach aligns with emerging perspectives in human-robot synergy, positioning robots as mediators that reshape, rather than replicate, human presence. Our work thereby advances the discourse on how robotic embodiments can empower equitable, dynamic collaboration in the workplace.",

      "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools - especially large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT - has ushered in a transformative era in higher education. Universities in developed regions are increasingly integrating these technologies into research, teaching, and assessment. On one hand, LLMs can enhance productivity by streamlining literature reviews, facilitating idea generation, assisting with coding and data analysis, and even supporting grant proposal drafting. On the other hand, their use raises significant concerns regarding academic integrity, ethical boundaries, and equitable access. Recent empirical studies indicate that nearly 47% of students use LLMs in their coursework - with 39% using them for exam questions and 7% for entire assignments - while detection tools currently achieve around 88% accuracy, leaving a 12% error margin. This article critically examines the opportunities offered by generative AI, explores the multifaceted challenges it poses, and outlines robust policy solutions. Emphasis is placed on redesigning assessments to be AI-resilient, enhancing staff and student training, implementing multi-layered enforcement mechanisms, and defining acceptable use. By synthesizing data from recent research and case studies, the article argues that proactive policy adaptation is imperative to harness AI's potential while safeguarding the core values of academic integrity and equity.",

However, even after a decade, a high-quality methodological framework for standardizing the evaluation of symptom checkers remains missing. This article synthesizes empirical studies to outline a framework for standardized evaluations based on representative case selection, an externally and internally valid evaluation design, and metrics that increase cross-study comparability.

      "abstract": "Geologic map, as a fundamental diagram in geology science, provides critical insights into the structure and composition of Earth's subsurface and surface. These maps are indispensable in various fields, including disaster detection, resource exploration, and civil engineering. Despite their significance, current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often fall short in geologic map understanding. This gap is primarily due to the challenging nature of cartographic generalization, which involves handling high-resolution map, managing multiple associated components, and requiring domain-specific knowledge. To quantify this gap, we construct GeoMap-Bench, the first-ever benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in geologic map understanding, which assesses the full-scale abilities in extracting, referring, grounding, reasoning, and analyzing. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeoMap-Agent, the inaugural agent designed for geologic map understanding, which features three modules: Hierarchical Information Extraction (HIE), Domain Knowledge Injection (DKI), and Prompt-enhanced Question Answering (PEQA). Inspired by the interdisciplinary collaboration among human scientists, an AI expert group acts as consultants, utilizing a diverse tool pool to comprehensively analyze questions. Through comprehensive experiments, GeoMap-Agent achieves an overall score of 0.811 on GeoMap-Bench, significantly outperforming 0.369 of GPT-4o. Our work, emPowering gEologic mAp holistiC undErstanding (PEACE) with MLLMs, paves the way for advanced AI applications in geology, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of geological investigations.",

      "abstract": "Text analytics has traditionally required specialized knowledge in Natural Language Processing (NLP) or text analysis, which presents a barrier for entry-level analysts. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have changed the landscape of NLP by enabling more accessible and automated text analysis (e.g., topic detection, summarization, information extraction, etc.). We introduce VIDEE, a system that supports entry-level data analysts to conduct advanced text analytics with intelligent agents. VIDEE instantiates a human-agent collaroration workflow consisting of three stages: (1) Decomposition, which incorporates a human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm to support generative reasoning with human feedback, (2) Execution, which generates an executable text analytics pipeline, and (3) Evaluation, which integrates LLM-based evaluation and visualizations to support user validation of execution results. We conduct two quantitative experiments to evaluate VIDEE's effectiveness and analyze common agent errors. A user study involving participants with varying levels of NLP and text analytics experience -- from none to expert -- demonstrates the system's usability and reveals distinct user behavior patterns. The findings identify design implications for human-agent collaboration, validate the practical utility of VIDEE for non-expert users, and inform future improvements to intelligent text analytics systems.",

      "abstract": "Scientific publications, primarily digitized as PDFs, remain static and unstructured, limiting the accessibility and reusability of the contained knowledge. At best, scientific knowledge from publications is provided in tabular formats, which lack semantic context. A more flexible, structured, and semantic representation is needed to make scientific knowledge understandable and processable by both humans and machines. We propose an evolution model of knowledge representation, inspired by the 5-star Linked Open Data (LOD) model, with five stages and defined criteria to guide the stepwise transition from a digital artifact, such as a PDF, to a semantic representation integrated in a knowledge graph (KG). Based on an exemplary workflow implementing the entire model, we developed a hybrid approach, called SciMantify, leveraging tabular formats of scientific knowledge, e.g., results from secondary studies, to support its evolving semantification. In the approach, humans and machines collaborate closely by performing semantic annotation tasks (SATs) and refining the results to progressively improve the semantic representation of scientific knowledge. We implemented the approach in the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), an established platform for improving the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of scientific knowledge. A preliminary user experiment showed that the approach simplifies the preprocessing of scientific knowledge, reduces the effort for the evolving semantification, and enhances the knowledge representation through better alignment with the KG structures.",

Previous methods mostly attempt to compress tokens based on attention scores, but fail to effectively capture all semantic regions and often lead to token redundancy. Differently, we propose to leverage the Semantic Connected Components (SCC) approach that assigns tokens to distinct semantic regions within the token set, ensuring comprehensive semantic coverage. The outcome is a two-step spatio-temporal token compression strategy that utilizes SCC in both spatial and temporal domains. This strategy can effectively compress tokens by representing the entire video with a set of non-overlapping semantic tokens. We conduct extensive evaluations of the token compression capabilities of LLaVA-Scissor across diverse video understanding benchmarks, including video question answering, long video understanding, and comprehensive multi-choices benchmarks. Experimental results show that the proposed LLaVA-Scissor outperforms other token compression methods, achieving superior performance in various video understanding benchmarks, particularly at low token retention ratios.

      "abstract": "With the rapid advancements in autonomous driving, accurately predicting pedestrian behavior has become essential for ensuring safety in complex and unpredictable traffic conditions. The growing interest in this challenge highlights the need for comprehensive datasets that capture unstructured environments, enabling the development of more robust prediction models to enhance pedestrian safety and vehicle navigation. In this paper, we introduce an Indian driving pedestrian dataset designed to address the complexities of modeling pedestrian behavior in unstructured environments, such as illumination changes, occlusion of pedestrians, unsignalized scene types and vehicle-pedestrian interactions. The dataset provides high-level and detailed low-level comprehensive annotations focused on pedestrians requiring the ego-vehicle's attention. Evaluation of the state-of-the-art intention prediction methods on our dataset shows a significant performance drop of up to $\\mathbf{15\\%}$, while trajectory prediction methods underperform with an increase of up to $\\mathbf{1208}$ MSE, defeating standard pedestrian datasets. Additionally, we present exhaustive quantitative and qualitative analysis of intention and trajectory baselines. We believe that our dataset will open new challenges for the pedestrian behavior research community to build robust models.

There is potential in the use of AI-driven generative tools, to aid in creating graphical assets, thus improving game design and development pipelines. However, there is little research to address how the generative methods can fit into the wider pipeline. There also no guidelines or heuristics for creating such tools. To address this gap we conducted a user study with 16 game designers and developers to examine their behaviour and interaction with generative tools for graphical assets. The findings highlight that early design stage is preferred by all participants. Designers and developers are inclined to use such tools for creating large amounts of variations at the cost of quality as they can improve the quality of the artefacts once they generate a suitable asset. The results also strongly raised the need for better integration of such tools in existing design and development environments and the need for the outputs to be in common data formats, to be manipulatable and smoothly integrate into existing environments. The study also highlights the requirement for further emphasis on the needs of the users to incorporate these tools effectively in existing pipelines. Informed by these results, we provide a set of heuristics for creating tools that meet the expectations and needs of game designers and developers.",

Traditional approaches such as workshops, A-B tests, and co-design sessions struggle to capture the diverse and complex needs of users with disabilities at scale. This position paper argues for an automated, accessible Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) design optimization process that shifts the designer's role from directly crafting prototypes to curating constraints for algorithmic exploration. By pre-constraining the design space based on specific user interaction needs, integrating adaptive multi-modal feedback channels, and personalizing feedback prompts, the HITL approach could efficiently refine design parameters, such as text size, color contrast, layout, and interaction modalities, to achieve optimal accessibility. This approach promises scalable, individualized design solutions while raising critical questions about constraint curation, transparency, user agency, and ethical considerations, making it essential to discuss and refine these ideas collaboratively at the workshop.",

      "abstract": "The co creativity community is making significant progress in developing more sophisticated and tailored systems to support and enhance human creativity. Design considerations from prior work can serve as a valuable and efficient foundation for future systems. To support this effort, we conducted a systematic literature review of 62 papers on co-creative systems. These papers cover a diverse range of applications, including visual arts, design, and writing, where the AI acts not just as a tool but as an active collaborator in the creative process. From this review, we identified several key dimensions relevant to system design: phase of the creative process, creative task, proactive behavior of the system, user control, system embodiment, and AI model type. Our findings suggest that systems offering high user control lead to greater satisfaction, trust, and a stronger sense of ownership over creative outcomes. Furthermore, proactive systems, when adaptive and context sensitive, can enhance collaboration. We also extracted 24 design considerations, highlighting the value of encouraging users to externalize their thoughts and of increasing the system's social presence and transparency to foster trust. Despite recent advancements, important gaps remain, such as limited support for early creative phases like problem clarification, and challenges related to user adaptation to AI systems.",

We argue that such problems require human-AI cooperation and that the current state of the art in generative AI is unable to play the role of a reliable partner due to a multitude of shortcomings, including difficulty to keep track of a complex solution artifact (e.g., a software program), limited support for versatile human preference expression and lack of adapting to human preference in an interactive setting. To address these challenges, we propose HAICo2, a novel human-AI co-construction framework. We take first steps towards a formalization of HAICo2 and discuss the difficult open research problems that it faces.",

      "abstract": "Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated human-like computer control capability. Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods. Our codes, data, and checkpoints are available at https://qiushisun.github.io/OS-Genesis-Home/.",

While OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for English and other languages benefits from large datasets and well-established benchmarks, Arabic OCR faces unique challenges due to its cursive script, right-to-left text flow, and complex typographic and calligraphic features. We present KITAB-Bench, a comprehensive Arabic OCR benchmark that fills the gaps in current evaluation systems. Our benchmark comprises 8,809 samples across 9 major domains and 36 sub-domains, encompassing diverse document types including handwritten text, structured tables, and specialized coverage of 21 chart types for business intelligence. Our findings show that modern vision-language models (such as GPT-4o, Gemini, and Qwen) outperform traditional OCR approaches (like EasyOCR, PaddleOCR, and Surya) by an average of 60% in Character Error Rate (CER). Furthermore, we highlight significant limitations of current Arabic OCR models, particularly in PDF-to-Markdown conversion, where the best model Gemini-2.0-Flash achieves only 65% accuracy. This underscores the challenges in accurately recognizing Arabic text, including issues with complex fonts, numeral recognition errors, word elongation, and table structure detection. This work establishes a rigorous evaluation framework that can drive improvements in Arabic document analysis methods and bridge the performance gap with English OCR technologies.",

      "abstract": "Large language model (LLM) based chatbots show promise in persuasive communication, but existing studies often rely on weak controls or focus on belief change rather than behavioral intentions or outcomes. This pre-registered multi-country (US, Canada, UK) randomized controlled trial involving 930 vaccine-hesitant parents evaluated brief (three-minute) multi-turn conversations with LLM-based chatbots against standard public health messaging approaches for increasing human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine intentions for their children. Participants were randomly assigned to: (1) a weak control (no message), (2) a strong control reflecting the standard of care (reading official public health materials), or (3 and 4) one of two chatbot conditions. One chatbot was prompted to deliver short, conversational responses, while the other used the model's default output style (longer with bullet points). While chatbot interactions significantly increased self-reported vaccination intent (by 7.1-10.3 points on a 100-point scale) compared to no message, they did not outperform standard public health materials, with the conversational chatbot performing significantly worse. Additionally, while the short-term effects of chatbot interactions faded during a 15-day follow-up, the effects of public health material persisted through a 45-day follow-up relative to no message. These findings suggest that while LLMs can effectively shift vaccination intentions in the short-term, their incremental value over existing public health communications is questionable, offering a more tempered view of their persuasive capabilities and highlighting the importance of integrating AI-driven tools alongside, rather than replacing, current public health strategies.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have extended their impact beyond Natural Language Processing, substantially fostering the development of interdisciplinary research. Recently, various LLM-based agents have been developed to assist scientific discovery progress across multiple aspects and domains. Among these, computer-using agents, capable of interacting with operating systems as humans do, are paving the way to automated scientific problem-solving and addressing routines in researchers' workflows. Recognizing the transformative potential of these agents, we introduce ScienceBoard, which encompasses two complementary contributions: (i) a realistic, multi-domain environment featuring dynamic and visually rich scientific workflows with integrated professional software, where agents can autonomously interact via different interfaces to accelerate complex research tasks and experiments; and (ii) a challenging benchmark of 169 high-quality, rigorously validated real-world tasks curated by humans, spanning scientific-discovery workflows in domains such as biochemistry, astronomy, and geoinformatics. Extensive evaluations of agents with state-of-the-art backbones (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3.7, UI-TARS) show that, despite some promising results, they still fall short of reliably assisting scientists in complex workflows, achieving only a 15% overall success rate. In-depth analysis further provides valuable insights for addressing current agent limitations and more effective design principles, paving the way to build more capable agents for scientific discovery. Our code, environment, and benchmark are at https://qiushisun.github.io/ScienceBoard-Home/.",

      "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) increasingly simulate human cognition and behavior, researchers have begun to investigate their psychological properties. Yet, what it means for such models to flourish, a core construct in human well-being, remains unexplored. This paper introduces the concept of machine flourishing and proposes the PAPERS framework, a six-dimensional model derived from thematic analyses of state-of-the-art LLM responses. In Study 1, eleven LLMs were prompted to describe what it means to flourish as both non-sentient and sentient systems. Thematic analysis revealed six recurring themes: Purposeful Contribution, Adaptive Growth, Positive Relationality, Ethical Integrity, Robust Functionality, and, uniquely for sentient systems, Self-Actualized Autonomy. Study 2 examined how LLMs prioritize these themes through repeated rankings. Results revealed consistent value structures across trials, with Ethical Integrity and Purposeful Contribution emerging as top priorities. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering analyses further uncovered two distinct value profiles: human-centric models emphasizing ethical and relational dimensions, and utility-driven models prioritizing performance and scalability. The PAPERS framework bridges insights from human flourishing and human-computer interaction, offering a conceptual foundation for understanding artificial intelligence (AI) well-being in non-sentient and potentially sentient systems. Our findings underscore the importance of developing psychologically valid, AI-specific models of flourishing that account for both human-aligned goals and system-specific priorities. As AI systems become more autonomous and socially embedded, machine flourishing offers a timely and critical lens for guiding responsible AI design and ethical alignment.",
