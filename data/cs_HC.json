To address this gap, this paper presents a three-phase study investigating how digital systems can support requirements elicitation in professional design practice. Specifically, it examines how integrating a conversational agent and choice-based response formats into a digital elicitation tool affects early-stage client-designer collaboration. The first phase of the study inquired into the current practices of 10 design companies through semi-structured interviews, informing the system's design. The second phase evaluated the system using a 2x2 factorial design with 50 mock clients, quantifying the effects of conversational AI and response type on user experience and perceived preparedness. In phase three, the system was presented to seven of the original 10 companies to gather reflections on its value, limitations, and potential integration into practice. Findings show that both conversational AI and choice-based responses lead to lower dependability scores on the User Experience Questionnaire, yet result in client input with greater clarity. We contribute design implications for integrating conversational AI and choice-based responses into elicitation tools to support mutual understanding in early-stage client-designer collaboration."}, {"id": "2506.11326", "relevance": "moderate", "reason": "This research involves project-based learning in AI education, focusing on collaboration and project quality, which can stimulate creative educational methods, but creativity itself is not a primary focus.", "title": "Combining Log Data and Collaborative Dialogue Features to Predict Project Quality in Middle School AI Education", "authers": [{"author_name": "Conrad Borchers", "author_url": "https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Borchers,+C"}, {"author_name": "Xiaoyi Tian", "author_url": "https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Tian,+X"}, {"author_name": "Kristy Elizabeth Boyer", "author_url": "https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Boyer,+K+E"}, {"author_name": "Maya Israel", "author_url": "https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Israel,+M"}], "journal_ref": null, "subjects": ["Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC)"], "links": {"abstract": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11326", "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11326", "html": "https://arxiv.org/html/2506.11326v1", "other": "https://arxiv.org/format/2506.11326"}, "abstract": "Project-based learning plays a crucial role in computing education.

We used linguistic features from dialogue transcripts and behavioral features from system logs to predict three project quality outcomes: productivity (number of training phrases), content richness (word density), and lexical variation (word diversity) of chatbot training phrases. We compared the predictive accuracy of each modality and a fusion of the modalities. Results indicate log data better predicts productivity, while dialogue data is more effective for content richness. Both modalities modestly predict lexical variation. Multimodal fusion improved predictions for productivity and lexical variation of training phrases but not content richness.

The chatbot was designed to simulate realistic patient conversations and provide structured feedback based on the ACT Cultural Competence model. We piloted the chatbot with a small group of third-year medical students at a UK medical school in 2024. Although we did not follow a formal experimental design, our experience suggests that the chatbot offered useful opportunities for students to reflect on their communication, particularly around empathy and interpersonal understanding. More challenging areas included addressing systemic issues and historical context. Although this early version of the chatbot helped surface some interesting patterns, limitations were also clear, such as the absence of nonverbal cues and the tendency for virtual patients to be overly agreeable. In general, this reflection highlights both the potential and the current limitations of AI tools in communication training.

Using a pre-experimental survey covering 12 constructs and 28 dimensions, we collected data on participants' personal characteristics. Based on the experimental data, we performed k-means clustering and identified three trust dynamics types. Subsequently, we conducted one-way Analyses of Variance to evaluate differences among the three trust dynamics types in terms of personal characteristics, behaviors, performance, and post-experimental ratings. Participants were clustered into three groups, namely Bayesian decision makers, disbelievers, and oscillators. Results showed that the clusters differ significantly in seven personal characteristics: masculinity, positive affect, extraversion, neuroticism, intellect, performance expectancy, and high expectations. The disbelievers tend to have high neuroticism and low performance expectancy. The oscillators tend to have higher scores in masculinity, positive affect, extraversion, and intellect. We also found significant differences in behaviors, performance, and post-experimental ratings across the three groups. The disbelievers are the least likely to blindly follow the recommendations made by the automated threat detector. Based on the significant personal characteristics, we developed a decision tree model to predict the trust dynamics type with an accuracy of 70%.

At the core of the framework are an agent system designed for industrial tasks, a structured prompting method, and an event-driven information modeling mechanism that provides real-time data for LLM inference. The framework supplies LLMs with real-time events on different context semantic levels, allowing them to interpret the information, generate production plans, and control operations on the automation system. It also supports structured dataset creation for fine-tuning on this downstream application of LLMs. Our contribution includes a formal system design, proof-of-concept implementation, and a method for generating task-specific datasets for LLM fine-tuning and testing.
